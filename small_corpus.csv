A2NX6MFZP8TM6S,B005A32W94,Deanokat,"[5, 6]","The concept of the Ambia ACH-120 Portable Two Zone Ceramic Heater is ingenious. A dual-module heater where one of the modules detaches and can be moved up to 6 feet away from the base unit? What a great idea! The heater also generates a decent amount of heat. But the big problem I have with it is the noise it makes. The fan itself is pretty noisy. And because it has a thermostat that cycles the unit on/off in order to maintain a desired temperature, the unit goes on/off quite frequently. To make matters worse, it's not a gradual on/off, either. It's a very abrupt on; and a very abrupt off. And when it goes on, there's a pretty loud click that accompanies that, too. I haven't owned a lot of ceramic heaters. In fact, I only have one other one. But that one has a fan that gradually slows down/speeds up in order to maintain the desired temperature. That approach is much less annoying, in my opinion. The noise this heater makes when it goes on/off even scares my cats. I really like the concept behind this unit. And it does a decent job of heating up a small room. I just don't like the noise it makes. One last point: It would be nice if this heater had more than just the one fan speed setting. A low/high option would've been a nice feature.UPDATE (2/16/13): This heater has been retired from use because of two reasons. 1.) The right unit only works intermittently now. It became a crap shoot as to whether or not the right side would work every time I turned the heater on. Sometimes it would. Sometimes it wouldn't. I felt like it was unsafe to operate the unit. 2.) My wife discovered that while the heater was running the plug got incredibly hot. Not just warm, but HOT. We never plugged it into an extension cord or power strip; only a grounded wall outlet. But the plug got so hot it was almost too hot to touch. Again, it seemed like a safety issue. We already disliked the very noisy fan and the loud clicking noise it made when it came on. The safety concerns were the last straw. I would recommend staying away from this heater.",1.0,"Nice concept, but kind of noisy. Safety concerns, too.",1317340800,"09 30, 2011"

A48E82VYNB12O,B00H1OUSD2,Steve Loves Amazon,"[10, 16]","See edit for why the Breville Infuser turns out to be my solution.---------I agree completely with the leading negative review. I have been on this road to serious cappuccino/espresso for some time, and I gave this machine a chance. I am the kind to tinker and find the way to make it work, but there is no case in which this machine is a good idea.I have been using a cheap Krups machine, and I can almost get good latte art on a decent shot with Crema with the Krups, which cost me $125. I decided to upgrade to the Silvia, and began to experiment, expecting it to take a long time to learn to use. I immediately bought fresh roasted espresso beans and threw out the older beans I had been using. I bought other new things to make it work, like tampers and pitchers for frothing.I could have made really decent cappuccinos someday if I had kept the Sylvia, but why bother? It is much easier (meaning still extremely difficult) to get the same good cappuccino out of a cheap machine. Why? Well let's look at the process I use on the Krups, and then compare to the Sylvia:1) put the milk in the pitcher in the freezer until it is about 33 degrees.2) grind the coffee with a hand ceramic burr grinder to the finest setting that still allows flow for the shot.3) preheat the cup and the portafilter.4) fill the portafilter not too full and don't tamp it.5) froth the milk in a small 12 oz pitcher with +3.00 glasses and lots of light, using the sweet spot to infuse the milk with microfoam by 110 degrees, then rolling it until about 150 degrees.6) swirl the milk while cleaning the steam wand, turn off the thermometer and drop it on the counter, still swirling milk.7) still swirling, selection switch to coffee mode and turn the steam/coffee engage switch to steam mode to spit a little steam and allow the light to go off, and then turn that same switch to coffee mode to spray boiling water into the cup and cool the system to the right temp for espresso. Still swirling.8) turn off the spray, insert the portafilter and turn it back on for about 4 seconds. Turn it off to let the puck soak and expand, again about 4 seconds. Turn it on again and pull the shot. Still swirling.9) turn off machine and pour pretty pattern on the just pulled shot before it can settle.If you search the Internet for instructions about using the Sylvia, you will find fairly similar instructions for making a cappuccino on it! It took me more than half a year to come up with this process for the Krups, and some of it I learned after using similar techniques to try to get the Sylvia to work. Why spend $650 to go to this much trouble? Worse still, the Sylvia is so fickle that even once you go to this much trouble, you will often lose a drink because the stars just weren't aligned.I hate to criticize other reviewers, but I have to say that the high rating this machine gets comes from a dream. You want to believe you are a Barista, as the leading negative reviewer actually is, but just owning this machine and wasting immense amounts of time and money doesn't make you one.The fact that the machine is Italian doesn't make some kind of grand engineering feat. It is an engineering disaster. It requires constant spewing of water, to be caught by its thimble-sized drip tray. If you spew too much water in steam mode, you'll burn it out. It isn't smart enough to shut down or refill the boiler. The portafilter barely fits, and the single screen design makes no sense. My machine never once was able to drop a puck properly out of the portafilter, either, even when it made a decent shot.In summary, I wouldn't want this machine for $125, let alone $650. I do plan to upgrade again, hopefully to something better than a cheap Krups this time, either making my drinks better or easier or both. The Silvia did neither.UPDATE 2/28/2014:A lot has happened since writing that review, and I haven't had time to update it. I had the Rancilio for a week or so, I think. I have since bought a Breville Infuser, and the first cappuccino was better than anything the Rancilio made. To put it bluntly, the only good thing about the Rancilio is that its brass boiler will last a long time. But that just means lousy drinks for longer, so even that isn't good!The real problem is that Rancilio is rife with incompetent design, and the Infuser, though it lacks a brass boiler, is full of good design. Since buying the Infuser, I make great drinks 5-10 times per day, and just a few weeks after getting it I am pouring decent latte art on my drinks, not only coffee espresso, but all kinds of strong tea drinks like rooibos, mate, and chai.By the way, I still froth with the Krups because it does a fine job, about the same as the infuser, so now I effectively have a double-boiler system for less than the price of the useless Rancilio!",1.0,Agreed: Fussy and finicky even at experienced hands; far more expensive than it seems.

Now just to let you know it is cheap so you are going to get what you pay for. Don't expect the exterior to be heavy and solid, it is not. I think its made of aluminum rather then steel but I could be wrong as I am not an expert in metals. I was enjoying my frying needs (fyi I made sure not to go over the max line with oil) when all of a sudden I put veggies in the basket and no I did not overfill the basket either, all of a sudden oil starts spewing over the sides onto the counter!!! I was freaking out!!! I grabbed the basket out of the fryer and it died down. This has never happened to me before so I just don't understand why this happened and no, the veggies were not frozen. After that happened I cleaned up and kept moving on dinner still had to be made. As I continued on I realized that you cannot access the digital buttons with the lid on. If you do the steam will seriously burn your fingers. So you need to make sure you set that timer before you place the lid on. The down side to this is that you have to put your arm over hot oil.Now just to let you know when you heat the fryer up to 375F and add your food it will drop to 325F the temperature will not go back up it will stay at 325F I learned this when I added my tofu to the basket and after 7 mins of it browning when I took it out the temp was 325F. Once you remove  the food you will need to wait a good 5 mins before it will get back up to 375F for you to put the next batch in. If you don't then the temperature will go below 325F, how much lower I don't know I guess it would depend if you are adding frozen or not frozen.The next day I decided to give it another go and it would not turn on at all. It was completely dead. I don't know if this is because of the oil spewing over or not but the machine worked just fine for an hour and a half after this took place. I was just done with the machine at this point. I was really hoping it would work out because it truly is a good price. but with all the issues I just rather send it back.I went ahead and returned it to amazon. I truly do commend amazon for their prompt easy return service. The package carrier showed up at my door the next day, took the box and gave me my receipt.Now what shocked me even more with amazon and their service is that I received an email from them that I would received my refund within 2 to 3 business days and sure enough I did! I have to say I can buy from amazon with confidence knowing how awesome they are about returns. I know this has nothing to do with the product but it was part of my experience with the whole process. I just had to give amazon that compliment because I see people all the time complaining about how their product died the next day or a few days and they just toss it because the manufacturer was not helpful and i'm here to say if its a matter of days go through amazon for your return! So 1 star for the product but 5 stars for amazon!Anyhow if you choose to purchase this product please be careful with you fingers and the lid situation.

I was able to find a phone number for rival/seal-a-meal (8005574825) which I called. It took three attempts to reach them due to busy signals and dead ends but when I finally did reach an operator, I was very disappointed. When I told them of my dilemma, the best they said they could do was give me a 25% discount on a new machine. They said they did not carry, nor did they know where I could get a part to repair my machine.  They actually suggested that I do a search on the Internet to find one of their parts. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was denied. I never got angry and never got an answer as to why a company that makes a product can not tell me why a customer support section of said company doesn't have the ability of providing information about parts for their machines.

The toaster has toasting slots that are just over 5 inches, which is part of the problem.Despite the Cuisinart name, this is a fairly basic toaster.  Given the chance to do it again, I would pick another toaster.  This one is a good deal but there are two features that I would prefer:1.  The Cuisinart toaster browns the bread more on one side than the other side of the bread.  It's not bad, but noticeable.  I'd pick one that toasts evenly on both sides.2.  The Cuisinart fits a traditional sized piece of bread, such as Wonder Bread or bagels (thick is ok in this toaster, but any longer won't fit).  Most of the bread I eat is in longer slices, such as sour dough or Oroweat.Note:  My rating is based on the toaster itself and not the incorrect description that's posted in the listing.Update, December 28, 2010:  It toasts inconsistently.  For example, I've kept it set at ""6"" and toasted bread from the same loaf.  Each comes out slightly more or less toasted than the one before it.  I've reduced my rating by one star (now rated at 2 stars).Update, September 10, 2011:  The toaster won't turn on anymore.  It's toast.

It comes in two pieces: a metal rack and hard, breakable clean drain pan.1) While the clean drain pan has indentations for the drainer rack's feet, it has no way to drain water to the sink. No holes, no lip, nothing.  Nada.  The lip is shallow and the pan fills quickly.  You have to stop everything when the water in the pan is close to the edge, manually dry the dishes in the rack, and then tip the pan into the sink. FAIL.2) While this does hold small, light weight plastic dishes, cups and glasses, its sleek low lines are unable to support glass, pottery or china.  That Pyrex baking dish? sure, if its the only thing going in the rack.  So for versatility: FAIL.3) The utensil caddy is, to quote Dorothy Parker, had me thinking &#34;what fresh H*ll is this?&#34;  The caddy is a molded section of the drain board pan (that doesn't drain)  with a couple side holes to allow for water to escape.  This means that your knife points, spoon handles and fork handles are in contact with water collecting from the stuff in the rack.  The idea of a dish drainer is to let the water drip off, not to have things standing in the water.  So from a logic standpoint, FAIL.4) Materials look good, but they are impractical.  The hard drain pan is shiny and clear, and if you keep it washed and dried with a soft cloth, it looks bad.  As for the rack, there is no way I would put a good china in it its hard and unforgiving basket, or on one of the rigid short cup holders. Materials: FAILI want very much to like the products that I am fortunate enough to try, but this went into the trash after trying to use it a couple times.  It is a clean design made by someone without regard for functionality, or the weight of various cooking and eating surfaces.  It comes with no instructions for its care, or an explanation of why it has no drain when it has a DRAIN BOARD as one of its main pieces, much like a washing machine with no hose to empty the washing chamber.So my one star review should be taken to mean that this is an epic fail of a product.",1.0,"Epic, Design and product FAIL",1401235200,"05 28, 2014"

(To be fair to Amazon, it was ordered just minutes before ""next day delivery"" closed.)Despite the fact that this gift could not be given because of its late arrival - after the intended recipient (visiting family) had returned home - I was able to convince my wife that this would be an ideal birthday present for me.  I had always wanted a machine where the touch of one button gave me an excellent latte or cappuccino, which I mostly prefer to shots of espresso.Prior to buying this I had spent a considerable amount of time on the web researching other super-automatics from Jura-Capresso and many other manufacturers.  The Jura-Capresso Z5 was my preference but the features of this model appeared to be almost as good for some $600 less.  The quality of frothed milk dispensed for a cappuccino on the Z5 looked impressive on a video I checked out.I expected this model to perform similarly, but what I got was froth of very poor quality and too cold.  It had many 1/2"" bubbles on the surface if I moved the froth selector closer to the ""steam only"" position to get warmer milk.This model will give a 16 oz coffee at the press of one button, but what you get is very weak, bitter and undrinkable.  Even a 7oz cup brewed to maximum strength was somewhat weak and bitter, since the entire 7 oz was passed through the coffee until it ran clear towards the end.  I had expected 2 or 3 (possibly 4) oz of espresso topped up automatically with hot water to the selected quantity rather than over-extraction to this extent.  The finest grind seemed rather coarse when I examined the dregs tray.  Maybe these are set up for people who like Megabucks-type charred coffee, so the oily beans don't gum up the grinder.  My preference for medium roast could certainly benefit from finer grinding.Tea or soup made with hot water from the dispenser would be a similar disappointment since the temperature of 8 oz of water hovered little more than 150 degrees (after pre-heating the cup).On the positive side, espressos of 1 or 2 oz were acceptable, though definitely not the quality of a semi-automatic machine.After some 24 hours during which I tried maybe 30 brews, changing many of the variables, I finally decided that this machine does not cut it.  My inexpensive Capresso Ultima regularly produces better cappuccinos and I prefer the ""espressos"" produced by my stove-top Mokka pots.Thankfully Amazon has a good return policy.

I got this one for beside my bed so that when my cat and dog lie beside me in bed, the airflow along the bed will draw the hair and dander towards my air purifier. Seems simple enough, and it worked well with the other fan.. NOT THIS ONE.Pros: It was cheap enough, and it was quiet enough even though it only had two speeds (low was more like Medium and HiGH was too high and noisy).  I had it running pretty much continuously for the first week. Then it got cold out and I turned it off one day. That night I tried to lean over to turn it on, and that's when you realize design flaws. First, the buttons aren't on the top, so that you can just push down with a single finger. The fan sits on the shelf attached to the side of the waterbed and is on the outside of the headboard, so I had to get up every time I wanted to turn it on, because you had to push the buttons with so much force that it just slid around. You had to use both hands to turn it on; one hand to hold the top of it, the other hand to hold the bottom of it and then use your thumb to turn it on. I had it for several weeks of annoying agitation, and since it worked okay, I certainly couldn't return it just because I didn't like it.  So I did the next best thing.. I bought a replacement that has the buttons on the top, and then I took this one outside and ran over the P.O.S. with my Big Truck Tires !!

A1FUBPW8U2RYUY,B002VK7D2K,"Subir Singh ""Gadget Geek""","[1, 2]","I really love OXO products and it breaks my heart to write this low rated review.Most non-custom and even some custom homes have very little storage space in the shower area. The OXO Pole Caddy seemed like a great product to increase shower storage in a small footprint - but it isn't so! This product is an example where the individual components are greater than the sum. Each component of the Pole Caddy is manufactured to the highest steel/rubber quality - quality that we have come to expect of OXO. The issue with the Pole Caddy is one of bad design.The Pole Caddy adjustment is advertised from 5 to 9 feet, but you can use just the top and bottom segments to get down to approx. 4 feet. There are two possible ways to adjust the height - remove a section for applications that require heights of less than 7 feet; for heights greater than 7 feet you need to connect all the sections and extend an inner tube in the bottom section. You connect the segments using a male screw type connection between segments.  Both these adjustments are inadequate to provide a stable base for hanging the shelves. The pole caddy is very unstable and you can feel the pole caddy buckle at the segment joins - due to the fact that the screw type connection only goes 1.25 inches into the segments. In my opinion a 3-6 inch screw connection would provide greater stability. To further deteriorate the stability, the rubber ends of the pole do not seem to grip either the ceiling or the shower pan (fiberglass or tile). I would expect some sort of large suction cup or non-slip rubber grip at least on the bottom side of the pole.I attached the bins/shelves with their friction-hold design and they seemed to hold on well, but the minute I placed a couple ~30 oz. shampoo bottles and a few other body wash bottles, it became extremely unstable. The final straw was a medium intensity nudge from my elbow and the bottom rubber grip gave way - Besides being inconvenient, it is dangerous (we have kids use the shower and there are razors, heavy bottles, etc.)I found that the stability improved marginally if you did not use the bottom segment extension. If you are within +1 inches of the following measurements, you will get the greatest stability from this product. 4 ft. 1/8 in.;  5ft. 1/8 in.;  6 ft. 2/8 in.; 7ft. 2/8 in.NOT recommended.Pros:* Good concept* Well finished components* Friction-hold design works - can position bins/shelves at any position along the poleCons:* Badly designed joins (too short - only 1.25"") keep segments unstable at connection points* Very unstable - bows and buckles.* Ceiling and floor grips do not hold - need suction cups/better grips at top or bottom to keep caddy stable* Extension on bottom segment increases instability* Can be dangerous if it slips out of place* Racheting mechanism is not truly racheting, i.e., no moving it back and forth to extend the caddy for a tight fit.

The kids ate more apples and other fruits.  There were no adjustments to make and the product performed well and was easy to keep clean.After trying those out at both my children's homes and listening to their raves, I decided to buy one for myself.  I went the cheap route and bought the Back to Basics peeler.  It does not have as long a shaft and is therefore impossible to use with long potatoes (they won't fit).  This peeler had to be assembled and adjusted before it could be used the first time - not so with the Victorio.  This peeler does not peel as uniformly as the Victorio.  It also drops a puddle of juice under the peeler as it removes the core and slices the fruit.  The Victorio leaves no mess.My neighbor had one of these and finally gave it to her maid.

I started off mixing 5 lbs of ground beef with the provided seasoning and quickly realized that I should have first tested the gun with 1 lb of ground beef.  I had read some other reviews which suggested first spraying the inside of the tube with non stick spray, which I did, but after the first pull of the trigger found that the back end would pop off.  I though that maybe I had not screwed it on right or tight enough to I put it on again, making sure to tighten it as much as possible with my bare hands.  The second time I pulled the trigger had identical results, the back popped off again.  I came to the conclusion that the meat was not lubricated enough so I took it out and re-mixed it adding some barbeque sauce to soften the meat a little more.  I took the time to wash out the tube and dry it then reapply a thicker coat of non stick spray and once again loaded the tube with the newly mixed meat.  Once again after the first pull the back end popped off.  I ended up having to make 5 lbs of burgers which were not too good because of the amount of salt in each season packet.

Keurig likes to tell people they need to descale because that means its a user problem and not a design problem. But using distilled water won't prevent the problem. If it did, a lot of us would be happier--not thrilled but happier. You need to read through all the comments to understand the prob. Keurig has changed the pumps in their design (or changed their pump source and materials) at last 3 times in the last two years but the problem isn't the pumps either; it's the valves.The most reliable way to unstick the valves is to remove the water tank, unplug the device, hold it upside down over the sink and give it a good whack on the bottom. Really, this works. If you think that's an ok way to operate a device that costs this much, then this machine is for you.More recently we've heard that Keurig support is telling folks that they cannot get a refund or replacement under warranty anymore because too many machines have been returned. Not honoring warranty? I don't see how that's legal. I can believe they are overwhelmed with returns, but that's the cost of business when you sell a bad design, keep selling it, keep insisting it's just scale build-up, keep refusing to support customers and continue selling the product.

My head was on its side, the pillow conformed to my head pushing my nose to the side and pressed against my throat which I hated, thats how little support it gave my head. Im so disappointed.

There is a design flaw with the canister where it is impossible to take it apart to clean the dust that collects (quite readily) between the screen and the filter.  I either use a shop vac or air compressor to get this accumulated dust removed. ( I do this about once a month.)  After every use, I have to take the canister outside and hit it with a can of air to clean the rubber seal so it will seal properly to use.2.  Pet hair...I have to hit my carpet at least 3 times (emptying the canister each time) to get all of the pet hair removed.  I do have a very hairy Golden Retriever but my last vacuum, a Hoover, only required going over the carpet once.3.  The hose is very difficult to use.  It has a solid tube that goes the length of the vacuum handle, and the flexible part of the hose is very stiff.  It's a workout to use and if you want to vacuum furniture, it is extremely difficult.  They should not have made part of the hose solid.4.  The crevice attachment has a brush attached that you cannot remove, and it slips down over the crevice tool when you are using it.  (I had to actually tape mine in place, but I'm thinking about breaking it off all together.)  Since it is attached, you have about 4 inches of tool to reach into areas, and it also makes it impossible to get under/between things that are less than 3 inches wide.  Want to vacuum under the fridge?  Forget it!The only positive I have to say about this vacuum is that I am saving money by not buying vacuum bags, but I am spending money on canned air to clean it.

A2G6MR877QOIPM,B0000AR7SY,Baywatch Bill,"[5, 6]","Grinds OK, but it is completely impossible to clean, let alone get all your ground coffee out. Being impossible to clean, don&#34;t even think about grinding seeds then coffee, etc. The top of the mill is removable, and you can wash it, but the bottom of the mill is attached to the machine body, so you have to physically pick up and turn over the entire machine, and then try to use the little bitty useless brush to clean out the bottom chamber. Except you can't, because the brush can't reach all the little nooks and crannies the brilliant engineers put in it, and because all the stuff is clinging to the sides from static electricity. When you hold the machine upside down  to try to clean, that's when you find out the ground coffee which is all supposed to fall into the catcher bin, also falls down BEHIND the bin. So when you pull the bin out, about half a scoop of your coffee is not in the bin, but in the floor of the catcher part. You either have to sweep it out into the bin, or, like me, not know it's there, and when you flip the machine over to clean it, all that loose coffee goes all over the countertop and to the floor. Total bummer. Read all the other one-star reviews and believe them.",1.0,Impossible to clean,1387929600,"12 25, 2013"

A3PPAPJOK12ZEG,B00009R66F,Sarahvbxl,"[2, 2]","I bought this cleaner on 11/25/2013. It died at the end of March 2014. I figured it was no big deal since it's under warranty for a year. I emailed Hoover and was told I had to drive about 40 minutes away to a guy who fixes these things for them in my area. There's no guarantee that they're going to fix it for free, only if that guy happens to find that it's a manufacturer defect. I assume mine is a defect since I was just doing regular, boring non-eventful carpet cleaning when it died, but I didn't think it was worth the hassle of driving around wasting time because I assume the guy's going to tell me I'm the one on the hook for the cost of fixing it anyway. I'm sure this is a normal way the companies deal with warranties but somehow this is my first time dealing with this kind of situation and I was surprised at the lack of customer service. Hoover definitely gets an F on their customer service report card.Overall:-It cleaned well during its 4 months of operation-It has a series of brushes that spin against the carpet to help lift stains, it did seem more effective than just water/cleaner alone-It is heavy and bulky, not anymore so than other similar cleaners but not an improvement over others either-The spray/suction ratio is good. It does a good job at getting the dirt up and the carpet dries pretty fast-The cord isn't very long. My vacuum and previous cleaner have longer cords than this one. Not by much, probably 5ft or so, still it's inconvenient.-The water tanks aren't easy to empty. The shape of them makes it so you have to shake them to get all the water out. You can't just turn them upside down and let them dry because the water will pool up around the edges and stay there until you shake it out. If you leave a little water in it, it'll smell like moldy mildew the next time you use it-Last but not least, don't expect it to last long! At least not from my experience!",1.0,Caveat Emptor!

A33HU6YM3BZE9T,B000BUDDVM,"STG ""esteegee""","[51, 59]","OK, first let's establish the fact that I am an extremely picky guy. Things that other people find acceptable, annoy me, especially when it comes to quality tools. To start, this is an expensive colander in my book. Therefore, I expected it to be above average. In some ways, maybe it is.First, as many have said; Yes, the holes are quite small. It drains fast and well, and you don't lose your orzo through the holes. It is obviously made by stamping a gazillion holes into a piece of stainless steel, and then forming it into the bowl shape, and adding the rim, base, and handles. Oh, excuse me, according to the description, the holes are ""precision pierced!""But, there, in that process lies what I consider a flaw. In stamping out the holes, they use a punch press fitted with a ""tool and die"" that pushes a gazillion small round pins against a sheet of stainless steel under which is a ""bed"" with holes to match the pins. It works just like a paper punch, except it punches all the holes at once. So, metal being somewhat malleable, deforms ever so slightly on the top when the punch pushes on it before it gives way and is cut through. Therefore, the top (in this case the inside of the colander) has a nearly microscopic bevel around each hole. That's a very good thing, because it makes the colander extremely smooth on the inside.BUT, the opposite side of the sheet of stainless steel undergoes exactly the opposite effect. When the little round blank gets pushed out into the die, a microscopic edge is raised all around the hole as the waste piece is pushed through. This means that there is a tiny little sharp raised edge around each hole on the outside of the colander. When you run your hand over it, you can clearly feel it. When you run your microfiber dish cloth or towel over it, it catches the microfibers and snags them.For me, it takes away the quality feel of the item, and diminishes its usefulness. It's rough and feels unfinished on the outside, compared to the nice smooth inside. There are manufacturing processes that could either avoid this or minimize it after the fact, so they could ship out a colander that is smooth on both sides, but that would add to the manufacturing cost. So, I'm not happy with the finish. It's cheap and careless. I expected better. It's like they intended to make a good product (which in other respects, it seems to be) and didn't finish the job.Update 10/24/13 - Well, this morning, I was forced to edit my review after a flurry of cooking activity last night. I used the colander to strain pasta (angel hair, to be exact) and was pleased to see not one escapee. After dishing the pasta I washed and rinsed the colander and set it into the drain board. This morning it is covered by a light layer of rust, yes you read it correctly.... brown, icky rust. Now I own probably 30 ""stainless steel"" items, that all get washed in a ""stainless steel"" sink, and NOT ONE of these items has ever developed so much as a spot of rust. Some develop darkening and colorful heat stains, but a little scrubbing with commercially available cleaners quickly restores the luster. So, I have to assume that this is a poor grade of stainless steel, and as such not suitable for daily kitchen use where it is subject to frequent contact with hot, high salinity liquids, such as pasta water and chlorinated sanitizers. The hunt for a better colander continues!",1.0,A Job Not finished - UPDATE,1381795200,"10 15, 2013"

It is awkward to keep the nutmegs inside while also loading the nutmeg which is currently being grated.The more important problem is a fatal design flaw in how the nutmeg being grated is held. Generally, it grates a nutmeg part of the way, and then the ""teeth"" inside which grip the nutmeg strip the nutmeg (like stripping a screw), and you are unable to continue grating.

I wasn't too worried about some of the other concerns since she only weighs 30 pounds. The joints that hold the sides of the bed together are plastic, and the first one broke in half the minute my husband tried to put it together!! If I had known the main corners were plastic, I never would have bought it.My husband is a very handy person, and he was really mad. We just moved into a new house in the middle of nowhere and we didn't want to have to deal with return shipping this huge thing, so he used epoxy to glue the plastic piece back together. Luckily, it's been holding for about a week, but still a giant disappointment, and I wouldn't be too shocked if our repair fell apart at some point.Additionally, the bed has a terrible formaldehyde odor. We thought it would dissipate after a few hours, and our new house is freshly painted, so windows are open all day. But just tonight, 10 days after we first got the bed, I closed the window to lay down with my daughter for bed and I smelled the sour formaldehyde odor still. It really really bothers me that my baby's bed has such a chemical odor in her room while she sleeps, and I'm going to take the mattress off and wash it down tomorrow.The design looks like a great idea, and I can fit large plastic tubs of her baby stuff underneath, which is why we got it to begin with. It does need a dust ruffle though, because it is quite ugly. The bed does not squeak at all and feels quite stable (despite the repair job!)I suggest no one buys this thing, but do continue to look for a similar product because it really is a great idea. Box springs are a waste of storage space!Update 2 months later: The bed still stinks! After some research, I think it is actually ""Urea-formaldehyde,"" which is like pee-formaldehyde. I took the whole dang thing outside and scrubbed it down with soapy water then let it air out in the sun for two days, and it still stunk. So we sealed it with acrylic spray sealant, and it STILL STUNK. The only thing that worked was to wrap each individual wood slat with multiple layers of packing tape. FML.

I wanted to see if coffee that wasn't always on a waming plate would taste better.The Krups coffee DID taste better; no burnt taste (although to be fair, the Braun-made coffee only tasted overheated when it had been on the plate for two hours.) The problem with the Krups coffee was that it cooled down - FAST.The carafe isn't huge, but I never made it to the bottom of the pot without the coffee being ice cold. Heating the coffee up in the microwave, as far as I was concerned, kind of destroyed the purpose for getting a thermal carafe in the first place.I didn't have the cold coffee problem long, though. That's because one day, for no reason I can discern, the carafe just shattered. Ta da. Like that. I was holding it to pour coffee and trying to figure out why the coffee was coming out of the BOTTOM of the carafe.So I cleaned up one holy mess that dripped off the counters and down the front of my wood cabinets (thank you, Krups.) Okay, I can be fair. I called Krups and they quickly sent me a new carafe.No more shattering carafe scenarios. Now I have a nice carafe and a coffeemaker that just quit working. It just makes horrible gurgling noises, and the water doesn't move at all from the reservoir.I gave up, boxed it back up, and took out the trusty old Braun. I don't know - why mess with success?

A2HADFGH442QE7,B00C6GQSUW,Scott,"[2, 2]","I ordered the DC40 around Christmas since our old vacuum was worthless and I'd heard good things about Dysons. The price was always the factor that made me pause but when I saw these refurbished ones on Amazon I figured I'd take a chance.So pushing this thing around it actually works pretty well. The 'ball' or whatever really does make it easy to move around objects and it does a good job of sucking most things up. We have all hardwood floors with a few rugs. There is a button you press to turn off the roller brush when you are on hardwood but unfortunately it doesn't remember the setting from the last time you turned it on so you always have to remember to turn it off if you are like us and using it on wood floors. Also, if you move the handle upright it switches to using the hose, so when you pull it back down again (to push) the brush starts rolling again. A minor annoyance but something I have to do every time. There are times where it won't roll over things you are trying to vacuum and I have to lift it and place it on top of whatever it was to get it to suck it up. Also this vacuum is not that great at sucking up human hair (especially my girlfriend's long hair) as it gets stuck in the roller brush and I'm constantly having to pull it all out.Now the reason I only gave it two stars is from the beginning using the hose never worked very well. It was hard to vacuum things with it as I'd have to almost place it directly on top of the item. Also you don't get that much hose as it's not very long and the hose is not very flexible. The 'retracting wand' or whatever is pretty pointless as it's about 2 1/2 feet long and a hard plastic tube so it makes trying to maneuver into corners or behind furniture very difficult. Most times I just take it completely off and use the attachments on the hose itself but like I mentioned it's not very long nor much more flexible. The vacuum ends up getting pulled behind you and smashing into whatever.So after a few weeks I decided to take the hose apart to see if maybe I had sucked something in there that was blocking the suction. When I took the hose out I saw the the gasket that seals the hose had buckled. I'll attach a picture that I took of this. I'm assuming it came like this since the hose never worked that great and I had never taken it off before this. Luckily this was within the minuscule 6 month warranty you get for the refurbished vacuum. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes on the warranty line I find out that I need to bring the vacuum into a service center for repair. I live 3 miles from Downtown Los Angeles and the closest repair shop I can take it to is about 20 miles away. There is a Dyson Service Center in Santa Fe Springs, but they are only open 8 - 5pm M-F and not on the weekends so trying to get it there is going to be a huge pain. (It's also right off the 5 in an area that has terrible traffic all the time)So in hindsight I'd probably just pay extra for the non-refurbished version as you get a 5 year warranty and during Black Friday or whatever Amazon has sales on these. I think last year they were $100 off which is pretty good.I'll update this review once I get it repaired to see if that helped the hose suction any.UPDATE: 6/5/2014: I just dropped the vacuum off a SECOND time for the exact same problem (the gasket in the hose becoming 'unstuck' and getting jammed in the tube causing the hose to lose suction) It's 50 miles round trip to the service dealer and they are only open Monday - Friday until 5pm. No weekends. The first time they did fix the vacuum but that only lasted 2 months before I had the exact same problem again. The repair guy said that he has never seen this before so I can only assume the problem is the refurbished vacuum, or possibly that Dyson's aren't just designed all that well. I really want to love this vacuum since when it does work it works well but this has been too much hassle. The Dyson representatives on the phone haven't been helpful at all, either.

If I was going to buy the linx stick vacuum plus the linx hand vacuum it would end up way expensive compared to this one.Here my list of dissapointments regarding the Presto:- the bin is way to small. Different from the linx that you just push and the bin opens on bottom dropping all the dirt and dust straight to the trash can. The hoover presto not only the bin is small but it's painful to empty. First you need to remove the hand vacuum, after that you remove the bin from the hand vaccum and after that you manually pull the cover of the bin (which is a little wall with the filter)- the suction: linx suction is better and stronger (of course we can't compare if a heavy corded vacuum). I noticed that part of the reason the vacuum catches the seed is because of the brush, when the brush catches the seed (the ""heavy"" ones such as the sun flower seeds) it keeps rotating with the brush until it is moved to the middle where the vacuum suction open is. So if it isn't the bush you would have to aim the vacuum opening to catch it.I also tried a little tiny piece of rock of a size of the sun flower seed, the rock spinned with the brush (I could see and hear) and suddenly it stopped. I thought: ""well, it catched and went to the bin!"". As soon I turned off the vacuum and lift to take it back to the charging station the rock just felt back to the floor. At the time the bin was empty so the suction must to be on its ""best"" performance.- once the presto drains the battery you need to put back to the charging station and wait for the next round to continue to clean. Different from the linx which has a removable battery, so for the linx I have two battery, if one goes out I just get the other that is sitting on the charging.- Linx is selfstand, so if you are going to take a break you can just leave your linx standing in any place. For the presto you need to find a wall because it doesn't stand by itself like any other decent vaccum.After all the cons I got I believe the hand vaccuum that comes with the presto is not a great advantage specially if the suction is not that great.",1.0,"weak suction, doesn't stand and tiny bin",1355443200,"12 14, 2012"
ARW83GO3CM907,B00006F2MI,Gentle Reader,"[0, 0]","I purchased this coffee maker in preparation for a kitchen renovation.  I had never owned an automatic coffee maker before and I always ground my own beans, so this seemed like a good choice.  Truly, it was a mistake.  First of all, the coffee was never hot enough when it was brewed.  As a result, I had to boil water first so that it would be hot enough when brewed.  Simply heating the inside of the carafe with hot water was not enough.  Even then, the coffee was never really very hot.  When the paper filter in the filter chamber was the tiniest bit askew, the coffee would flood out onto the counter.  To solve this, I used a gold filter with a paper filter inside.

Even if you have since thrown it out, let CPSC know what is going on with the controls going wacky as this product can still be purchased.  This item needs to be taken off the market.I wanted and received this as a gift about 4 or 5 years ago.  We used it once in awhile, but it was so much more convenient to just use the smaller toaster to make toast as this is a large piece of equipment and I didn't store it on my counter all the time.  I'd say we used it about 3-4 times a month except during the holidays, Superbowl, and Daytona 500 when it was used almost everyday, three or four times a day.However, about 2 months ago my main oven broke.  We needed a bit of time to save up for a new one so I thought, ""no problem, I'll just keep the Cuisinart toaster oven on the counter and use it as I would my oven.For most of that time it worked great.  Then, yesterday I came home from work and smelled an electrical/baking sort of odor.  I looked at the toaster oven and the light was on.  My first thought was ""stupid me, I left it on"" so I went over to turn it off and it was in the off position. But the oven was hot.  I would guess it was at least 150 degrees.  I don't know how long it was on, but I do know there was absolutely no way to shut it off except to unplug it.It did cook great.  I made everything from chicken nuggets to pizza to pork chops to brownies in it.  I didn't even miss my big oven that much and started counting how much money I was saving in electricity by heating only this small oven for dinner and I considered leaving this on my counter permanently for those smaller meals I had to bake.  However, rest assured, I did not save enough to replace the contents of my house had this thing caught on fire while I was at work.Now had this been a cheap $[...] Durabrand (Walmart brand) toaster oven, I would have chalked it up to a ""you get what you pay for"" kinda thing.  But after taxes this thing was close to $100.00????  For that kind of money for something like a toaster oven, I would expect that maybe I could pass it on to my kids!

A3P3S46A8MXK10,B00005851Y,"Jane ""Jane""","[6, 7]","I had a few problems with my grill.The first problem was that the bottom plate got hotter than the top plate, so the food had to be turned over to ensure even cooking. The whole point of having two cooking surfaces is that you don't have to turn the food during the cooking process.The cooking plates got too hot, so the outside of the food got a little burned and dry by the time the inside of the food got cooked. I especially noticed this when I cooked chicken breasts and Italian Sausages. This might not be a problem if you're cooking something thin, like bacon.The drip tray is just plain messy.  It has to be perfectly aligned with the grill, if it's off by just a little bit, you have drippings all over your counter or cooking surface.  Even if you carefully center the tray when you start cooking, it's easy to bump it without realizing it. They should make some kind of rack to hold the tray in place. Also, the tray isn't that deep, so you have to be really careful when carrying it to the sink, so you don't spill the drippings everywhere. This is a particular problem when you cook something that drips a lot of grease, like Italian Sausages or Bacon.Finally, while the cooking surfaces are supposed to be nonstick, I had a lot of trouble cleaning them.  Juices from the food stuck to the cooking plates and charred during the cooking process.  You can't soak them in water and can't use steel wool to clean them, so you're stuck scrubbing and scrubbing to get them clean.  Some people have recommended sticking a wet washcloth or papertowel inside when you're finished cooking and while the grill is still hot.  I tried that, but it didn't really help that much.I bought the George Foreman Grill to make my life easier, but in the end it was more trouble than it was worth. I found that I was better off just cooking my food in a non-stick pan on the stove top. Sure, the grease doesn't drip off, but you have more control over the cooking temperature, so your food doesn't burn, you don't get grease all over the place, and cleanup is easier. My grill was just taking up space and collecting dust, so I got rid of it.If you REALLY want one of these grills, I suggest looking in a second hand shop (like Goodwill or The Salvation Army), checking at yard sales, or asking your friends.",1.0,Not that great,1243728000,"05 31, 2009"
A1ZSF5CJ0A4CIO,B002HO7FBO,Purpledog,"[6, 7]","Been watching these for quite some time. Finally saw this B77 on QVC for $139 and change PLUS it came with 72 K-cups and the ""MY K-Cup"" included for that low price;got it on a day with free s&h; offered also.Removal from shipping carton was a breeze (provided one follows the instructions placed directly inside the top flap for removal, otherwise, you have a 30-minute fight on your hands and the brewer is going to win inside the carton). Set up is a breeze provided you have a dedicated outlet for it. It is quiet, nice looking, functional - for about 6 days. On the 6th day it kept turning itself off after each brewing cycle. On the 7th day it kept indicating ""add water"" when the reservoir was full. On the 8th day, when I managed to get it to stay 'on' long enough to make a cup of coffee/tea, no matter what capacity setting I had it on, it had a mind of its own. Getting it to dispense the appropriate amount of water for the cup size I had programmed was a crap shoot. If I programmed small, I got large, if I programmed large, I got small or medium. One time I programmed medium and it overran my travel mug which is large...what a mess. Thank goodness it was just water for my good old tea bag in the mug so I didn't have too much to clean up. (Note: when the machine turns itself 'off', according to the troubleshooting section of the manual, it is time to 'descale' the brewer which is required every 3-6 months depending on what type of water is being used. However, after 5 days use, I didn't think descaling was necessary and if it was, I was pretty sure I wouldn't be happy or willing to be descaling this thing every week).Because I had already registered the warranty with Keurig, I contacted their CS via e-mail. Their website advises a 1-3 day period for a response based on their 'busiest time of the year'...ok, if they say so. I think it is their busiest time of year because this is a piece of junk (for a lot more reviews on this particular model, check out QVCs reviews on Item #K30256 which is no longer available but the reviews are still there).Had I read the QVC reviews and not merely the Amazon reviews, I never would have purchased this product no matter what the price. Anyway, contacting Keurig CS - got an acknowledgement in a day and a response in exactly 3 days. They are sending a replacement complete with free K-cups (48) and I can trash the original product; no need to spend the time or money to send it back to either them or QVC.If you're salivating over this machine, do your homework. Read every review you can find before deciding. Wish I had been more astute in my research. My replacement arrived this morning from Keurig via Fed Ex (can you believe that?) and unlike the original, I don't seem to have any excitement at setting it up and trying it out but I know I must.

The carpet option is very powerful, and too strong for the older rugs, which is very surprising for such a lightweight vacuum.  So, this vacuum is pretty useless if you're looking for a solution to caring for delicate rugs.  It worked pretty well on floors, although, on anything pea sized, it would roll over it.  I used it maybe once per month and, after one year, the vacuum started overheating after about 5 minutes and part of it would shut down.  Now, after about 3 minutes of use on bare floors, it overheats and the whole thing shuts down...it's as if it became unplugged...stops dead.

Here's what's wrong:The magnet is too weak to hold most can lids and the magnetic arm is too long to fit the top of smaller cans, like tomato paste. Also, you'd think the feature of being able to remove this component for cleaning is a good thing... BUT it keeps popping off when in use!After cutting, the unit is supposed to hold the opened can until you release the magnetic lever. Sometimes this is _barely_ holding the can. Although it hasn't happened yet, I'm fully expecting a can of soup or tomato sauce to drop all over the place. I hang onto the can--just in case.There is a sort of snap lock to keep the main unit attached to the cabinet mount. The trouble with this part is that in the middle of opening a can it pushes back, sliding the unit away from you while you are trying to mount a can.The cutting mechanism is fussy... sometimes seating properly over the edge of a can but most times not. It's trial and error getting the thing to bite into the can.I find the unit pretty noisy.All in all, I'd give my old Black & Decker 5 stars, this one deserves none.",1.0,Four Stars?

Fixing it is prohibitively expensive.Shame on you, Hoover! Okay...let me tell you the long, ugly story. I'm at the age when I cannot lug upright vacuums around one floor, much less up and down two or three. Canister vacs are so much more convenient, but I only like the ones with powered nozzles/heads because the others just don't clean carpets. So I bought my first one of these (yes, you read that right...) in July 2011. I loved it. It was powerful enough for the money and easy to clean, move around, etc. So I bought a second one for my upstairs in July 2012. After one year, the powered head on vac #2 died. It didn't just get sick, it DIED. The roller simply became unmovable.Okay, I think rather naively, I'll go online and buy a new roller and fix it. After all, I've fixed my own Oreck uprights for years. Uh...no. You cannot buy parts for the powered head. You have to buy the whole blasted head. Okay, I think, still in the grips of a powerful naivete, I'll buy the new head because I really like this vacuum cleaner. Guess how much the powered head costs? New, $125; used, I found one for about $80 not including shipping. And this for a vacuum cleaner that retails for less than $200. Come on, Hoover. Really? Did you think your customers wouldn't notice that they can't replace basic parts on their vacuum cleaners? As for getting it fixed, let's be real. I live in one of the highest cost areas of the U.S. where repair people won't even look in your direction for less than $200.I decided to keep using vac#1 until its powered head goes (which I'm sure it will before long) and then buy a different brand. You see, Hoover, you not only lost me on THIS vacuum cleaner, you lost a customer for life with this nasty little trick.

It cooks much better and faster than this one did._______________________________________Old review:Just an electrical broiler. That's about it.And that would be perfectly fine and worth 5 stars, if manufacturers didn't present it as something totally different.Pros:1. It uses less energy that the full size oven does2. Does not heat the environment as much3. CompactCons:1.Food takes about twice longer to cook than it says in  their recipe book.Their bacon and eggs recipe claims that the bacon is going to be ready in 10 min and ""perfectly soft eggs"" in just 4. The truth is that the bacon took 16 minutes to be crisp and the eggs where still very runny on one side and hard on the opposite side  after 8 minutes. Which leads to the next point:2. Cooks only from the top. You do have to flip your burgers and such if you don't want to have one-side cooked food.3. No two level cooking is happening whatsoever. I had potato wedges on the bottom rack and turkey thighs on the tall rack. Thighs where ready in about 35 minutes  (I had to flip them once), but potatoes where completely raw until I removed turkey and gave it another 25 minutes.  And I used 450F and high fan.4. The box says ""No pre-heating"", but each recipe says ""don't forget to use pre-heating cycle"" which takes 6 minutes.After I figured out all these things I decided to keep it because it still is a convenient way to cook , but it's not a miracle device by any means, just a compact round see-through broiler._________Heating element blew after only 5 month of use. I contacted  the seller. They want you to ship the unit back to them along with the check for $18 (still on warranty), wait until they fix it and than get it back.

I started leaving mine in the stand while cleaning just to not risk breaking it trying to get it in & out.  Also the 4 legs of the stand are wobbly and they don't make the unit feel solid like some rubber-bottomed french presses do.Secondly, the carafe itself is made out of paper-thin glass - I broke one just trying to gently get it out of the holding stand, and it appears the 2nd one I have is chipped inside the glass and won't be lasting much longer (note, I've only had it 2 weeks!!).Thirdly, I do not like the way the filter on the plunger works.  It is hard to plunge, has no rubber guides on the glass to keep the coffee in the right place, it is hard to clean (since coffee gets under the filter & the metal plate), AND it leaves a shot of coffee at the bottom of the carafe with the grounds that is very hard to get out.Lastly, I do not like the spout filter or the lid itself.  The spout filter is a joke (I think even a quarter of a coffee bean could get through!), so it's absolutely pointless.  The only thing it does is help it pour unevenly because of the slits.  The lid does not fit on snugly after a plunge, and if you're not holding it down while pouring, you are going to have a big coffee mess on your hands.I will say the coffee tasted great coming out of these, but that has been my experience with all french presses.

I have lower back problems and like a mattress that is a little firmer, so after reading many of the reviews I decided it was worth the risk buying this online without being able to try it first.First off I would like to say that yes I made sure it was right side up.When this first arrived I opened it, let it expand and air out for about 24 hours. I didn't notice much of a smell. For the first few months it felt like I was sleeping on a board this mattress was so hard. There was no give or sinking in at all. I could actually feel a gap between the mattress and my lower back where it curves.After that it started softening up a little. Over time it softened and molded to me so much that the heavier parts of my body, mainly my hips and rear sank in excessively. I'm 5' 7"" and weigh 150 lbs, so I'm not overly heavy.Over the last 6-7 months I started having a lot more back pain at night and in the mornings than I've ever had. At night I would actually have to support myself with my hands and/or elbows to be able to turn over. Most mornings I could barely get out of bed because I hurt so bad. During the night and after I first got up I was in immense pain if I had to sneeze or cough because my muscles were so stiff and painful. After I'd been up for 20-30 minutes I could move better, but was still in more discomfort than I've ever been throughout the day. It had gotten increasingly worse from sometime before Christmas to now.It was never comfortable, but definitely more comfortable in the beginning. My husband didn't like it from the very first night as well. Also it did trap quite a bit of heat. I like a cold room and warm bed to sleep in, but this mattress made me sweat many times.Last week I went to my local furniture store and after trying a few mattresses out bought a Simmons Fancy Pillowtop. My pain was 75% better after the first night. I'm still in a little pain, probably always will be, but I can turn over without having to support myself and haven't had any trouble getting out of bed in the morning because of pain.

A2KJY3CA1CB1GE,B004YZEOGI,S. Young,"[33, 36]","1 starWhy one star? This is Cuisinart!Well, I believe that something that costs 70 dollars, or regular price 130 dollars better stand up to its name and cut like a hot knife through butter.Now, I have the Swissmar Borner V slicer that I got for 30 dollars and it's actually a really good mandoline. But I thought the Cuisinart would be so much better.I mean, with the straight edge it has a waffle cut edge, a grater, a thin and thick julienne for an identical cut and fries. AND- you can dial in the thickness you want.The Swissmar has a straight edge that can be a thick or thin, and the thin and thick julienne.First off, the Cuisinart is really good looking, it's durable with metal parts, and the back legs flip out so it stands on its own, it even has a glove so you don't cut yourself. If looks were a part of this, it would get stars for it - and maybe that's part of why it gets one star.I did an onion on the thinnest setting first and it went through pretty smooth. The food holder that you use so you don't cut yourself has 4 prongs and the push in tabs on the sides moved the food down as you slice. It was pretty cool, but I soon learned that there's a  inch high side to this mandoline, so  of your food doesn't get cut. My Swissmar has one too, but it's about an 1/8 of an inch.Next, I try out carrots. These are hearty homegrown carrots from my garden. The cuisinart didn't like them, they stuck halfway through the straight blade on a thicker setting and they even jerked a little in the thinnest setting. Swissmar whizzed through them, thick or thin.I then tried the grater with the carrot. I got little pieces when I pushed. So that was a fail (mind you, I did to cheese and it went fine, but that's a waste of time to get that out for cheese in my opinion).Lastly, I went to the thing we get a mandoline out for. Russet potatoes and uniformly cut fries. The thick julienne is a standard fry cut. I had to push it to get it through, and I mean hard. Is this why they give you a protection glove? On top of that, it didn't cut the potato cleanly; I had to pull them all apart the last 1/16 of an inch.Then I tried the waffle cut blade. ------- I couldn't get the potato through on a thicker cut, and it was so thin on the thinnest cut (and that took some work) that it wasn't worth it. Not only that, if you want to do a round cut by standing half a potato on end, I had to use the Swissmar holder because it has six prongs close together, I couldn't put carrots or upended potatoes on the Cuisinart one. (working it through I damaged both holders because I had to push so hard).The pros I had were the flap that closes over the exposed blades is nice, the weight and durability, the dial for thickness and that the holder had the squeeze buttons to push the food down toward the blade.Most cons I've listed above but add in - The glove is pointless, I want sharper blades and more prongs in the holder. This should work so smoothly that slicing anything should be easy.Overall, I would not recommend this mandoline. Save yourself some money. I'll stay with my Swissmar.",1.0,Ummm.... no.,1351382400,"10 28, 2012"

AW5SPOBEMFZ7Q,B003ZDNKVA,"Dr. A. White ""Scientist""","[109, 134]","UPDATE JANUARY 2013:  Judging by some of the follow-up comments to my initial review, it appears DeLonghi finally has filters available (third-party, too) and has decided to support this fryer.  They're not the first company to get ahead of themselves in a new product launch as appears was the case here.  You should read the comments and pay particular attention to the dates they were written.  New information always is good.While Delonghi may have a good idea with the introduction of the D28313 Roto Deep Fryer, here are several things about which a potential buyer should be aware.FIRST, many retailers are using descriptions of older model fryers in their advertising and descriptions of the D28313.  For example, there is no included oil container in which to drain the used oil.  The basket capacity is 2.2 lbs, not 1.5 lbs.SECOND, you might want to know the cost and availability of filters when considering this model.  Delonghi parts lists one filter, P/N 5312510071.  The cost is $15.90 for one filter, which includes shipping and handling.  The same Delonghi customer service department representative told me the filter may be used twice if frying fish.  That means you must factor in $8 per fish dinner, plus you must order and have on hand filters sufficient for your use.THIRD, there are no replacement filters available at any price.  Delonghi doesn't have them and has no idea when they will.  Filters for Series 5 and 8 fryers will not fit.FOURTH, the owners manual (with the unit and online) says not to use the unit with clogged filters, but the manual makes no mention of using the unit without a filter.  But then, one of the benefits of a closed fryer, namely, low odor, immediately is lost.  The owners manual is so vague (""... if your unit has ...""), there's no telling whether or not use of the fryer without a filter would be hazardous.BOTTOM LINE:  Buy this fryer, use it two or a few times, and you've got a $100 paperweight.  They're not the first company to get a product launch out of sequence, but at least until Delonghi decides they're going to support it, I'd stay away from this fryer.Thank goodness for Amazon and their return policy.",1.0,Ready - Fire - Aim,1308528000,"06 20, 2011"

This mixer isn't it! The design is horrible--unless you buy the extra pouring shield, it is nigh impossible to neatly add ingredients without turning off the mixer and removing the bowl. The beater-junk! The plastic chips off almost immediately, and heaven forbid you drop it. The bowl design is also terrible--there's a big hump at the bottom, which creates a well that causes dry ingredients to stay dry. This occurs even when I use just the bowl and a spoon to mix. Terrible!And why do they only include one bowl? Every mixer I've ever bought came with two--a small and a large, which is very handy when mixing dry and wet ingredients separately. For the price they couldn't include one more steel bowl? Because of the one size and design of the beater movement, forget scraping the sides with a spatula. You'll have to remove either the beater or the bowl to do it with this design.I have, however, had ok luck with the dough hook and making bread dough. Except that the dough hook's plastic is chipped along the seam, which is odd since I've used it maybe a dozen times. So while my motor hasn't burned out as others have complained, my bread has contained little flecks of white plastic coating.I don't understand why people rave about KitchenAid mixers. I have a Cuisenart food processor--that's worth the money. It's clearly better than any other processor I've owned, I use it almost daily and it's still in perfect shape.

It was quieter and more compact than other juicers we looked at but after 6 months of use, it stopped working and the side of the plastic container blew out. I was juicing some small cut up beets mixed with other vegetables as I always did so as to not run the motor too hard and all of a sudden, there was a loud pop and a piece of the plastic on the rim of the cup broke and flew in the air and the motor just quit. Mind you we only used the juicer about once a week to make about a quart of fresh vegetable juice so there was no excessive use at all. From the very beginning it seemed like the juicer was struggling to break down what we put in it especially the harder items like carrots and beets. It consistently seem to get backed up and we'd have to reverse to get it going again. But the last time, it just blew up. I had never experienced anything like this even with the cheapest of juicers. My take on this is that the unit itself is just too small for the motor and the parts don't fit properly and snugly enough together. There is also too much plastic for a unit at this price range. Also the chute is on the smaller side so that you can't put whole pieces of anything down there, everything had to be cut up.

We took it apart, basically this design is living on borrowed time as the unit will eventually fail.Sunbeam placed the actual electronic switch below the aluminum bowl part and on top of the plastic housing.  The grey button on the top is nothing more than a lever to another piece that actually depresses the electronic switch below the aluminum bowl.  The real electronic switch is less than an inch from where the water flows from the aluminum bowl and out the dispenser.  That switch, also sits right next to the heating element.  Now you don't need to be an engineer to know that electronics don't care for heat and they don't care for water.  In our case the heat killed the electronic ""on"" switch.

I had grown up with parallel clotheslines but my current yard is sloped and mostly shady, so I wanted an umbrella type that I could place in the sunniest area.The dryer arrived with machine lubricant on it, which I was pretty much expecting (based on other reviews of the larger model of this item) but it was fairly easily cleaned off.I knew there were going to be problems, though when I set it up. The line itself is cheap plastic that sags and stretches, and it's a bit of a pain (to say the least) to tighten it, and it's very difficult to get it taut. Also, the top itself did not seem square even though I set it up exactly as the directions stated. I was careful to balance the clothes on either side and started in the center. After hanging three loads of not very heavy laundry (T-shirts and lightweight items) I heard a kind of sickening ""pop"" and an entire side was sagging. One of the hinges on the arms had bent. Since the clothes were only half dry, I let it go until later when I was able to pack it up for return.After reading some other reviews on a different site, it seems this is a fairly common problem...the hinge and arms are made of aluminum, not steel like the center post, and evidently can't take the stress. So disappointing. I had read glowing reviews of this product with people stating they place four large loads of laundry on it each week. There was still plenty of room on the rack on which I could have done this, but three light loads was clearly the maximum that could be held. Perhaps these other folks were hanging baby clothes and lingerie?I got a refund on this item and I think I am going to next try the umbrella type with the slanted arms. Another issue I had with this dryer was that the lines seemed awfully close together. After almost 8 hours in mostly sun, on a 100 degree day, the clothes in the middle lines were still fairly damp. (This was not due to the rack breaking, as the clothes were sagging but not touching). I was not drying anything particularly thick and heavy (jeans or furniture covers, for example) so I think it was mainly due to a problem with air circulation.All in all a very disappointing experience. I would love to be able to find the kind of solid, old-school, permanent umbrella type that I remember from my youth, but sadly those seem to be gone.

To be able to sear you have to set the temp first, wait for the grill get to that temp (which takes 20 minutes or more), then press sear and wait for the sear temp to rise, another 8-10 minutes. First cooked steak (wanted medium-rare), I set the temp to 350 per the manual and pressed sear. Put the steak on and waited for the 'beep'. Cooking one steak took 15 minutes--total cooking time, 40+ minutes. Steak was close to well-done. Next time I used sear, I set the temp to 200, hit the sear, cooked the steak until 'beep.' Steak was medium-well. Cook time, 32 minutes. Third, and last time I will use this, set the temp to 200, hit sear, put steak on and cooked the steak for 4 minutes, bypassing the 'beep'. Steak was a bit pink, but not MR. IF you could only hit the sear button, perhaps this would cook a MR steak and cut the cooking time, but it doesn't allow you to do that. Cleanup is a disaster. If you cook 2 steaks, the plastic grease cop overflows. Because the top and bottom are not attached trying to wipe the top clean is a chore as you have to hold the bottom so the grill does not slide.

A1SJDEUQ1N96ZJ,B000J6DXHW,Uncle Buck,"[4, 6]","This frier appears to have been designed on a computer somewhere, and emailed to China for production without any test runs.This is a prototype with wild design errors that come up on early prototypes. The mating of the oil drain and oil receive components will only match up on a computer simulation, not on some bodged product that was bashed out of metal foil in the bowels of China.After inspecting the thing, I had to do the rework that should have been done in the factory, but I couldn't make up for the design. The correct metals were not used for some parts and so they were distorted and cracked because they lacked the plasticity and quality for stamping that the engineer specified... causing me to wonder what was swapped in and contacting my oil. One part apparently didn't fit together right and so it was bent over with pliers or something and its mating component was shaved down from the two parts being forced together just to get it into the box and out the door.The part that transfers the oil from the fry chamber to the plastic container doesn't really fit right, and any engineer should have caught this obvious problem. The receiving part needed to be at least twice the size so that the oil would land in it even after it was built poorly and didn't match up. Instead, that receiving part is smaller than the oil sending unit, any oil that doesn't perfectly land in it is directed out of the area and onto the counter, and when you pick up the plastic oil container (covered with oil and sitting in oil) the container does not have any closure to keep the oil in, so it's going to keep pouring all over the place.Even though I paid a premium for some oil filter feature, 2/3 or more of the oil goes onto the counter, so the entire feature is a waste of money. To top that off, it leaks just sitting there, so having the drain valve just wastes oil. Before you ask, I paid close attention to only putting the correct amount of oil in the machine, and even after I propped the pan it was sitting in up from the back to help compensate for design error, the oil container was in no danger of overfilling... the cake pan that I had put the frier in was in danger of overfilling!When I said this thing is made of foil, I'm not exaggerating. There is an outer metal body and an oil pan that sits in it. If you lift up the metal body alone - which only weighs a few ounces - it will bend and distort under its own weight. It requires the oil pan with the weight of the oil in it just to hold its shape... and even then it's just functional and not straight lines. The lid will never fit right because the frier is never the same shape twice.The lid has a window in it... this window is fogged up the moment you put food in the oil because of the moisture frying out of the food and condensing on it. It is there for the pre-purchase pictures only. Another computer design that was not tested before production.Although I haven't had any trouble with cooking time yet, and in fact it's cooked quickly the two times I've used it so far (and I don't expect it to last long or I would have given it a higher rating just because of that), the typical voltage in my house is 125V and if I'm using any other appliances, it will not reach temperature. I don't discount the people who say it doesn't cook their food, because this thing is on the threshold of not being able to achieve temperature even with my excessive house voltage. This thing is designed so poorly that it dissipates most of its heat out of the oil into its sides, leaving little for cooking and excessive power draw.All of the friers I looked at looked bad and every one of them were from China. I just picked an expensive one and hoped for the best. Don't do the same, you'll just throw away your money. If you can find some kind of 120V commercial frier or something, perhaps you may get what you pay for. This thing is just an expensive, leaky, beer can.I was surprised to get a fistful of papers inside the box with this thing. Most of them are loose-leaf tips and advice to counter the common problems encountered with the device. The manufacturer is aware of the problems, but keeps shipping them and doesn't want you sending it back. If I'm reading the various languages in the general manual correctly, this unit is sold in a whole lot of third world countries. It's likely that they are only paying what it's worth though, and that's just a buck or two. I decided to look in the recipe book... I'm not sure if the featured chef is a real person, but every recipe requires his brand of spice blend and the recipe book is actually a misprint. Half of the pages are upside down and the pages are out of order. That doesn't matter though, because it doesn't specify what the spice mix consists of, and I don't think the recipes were written within this machine's capabilities anyway.",1.0,Let's go for a swim,1371600000,"06 19, 2013"

AVU1ILDDYW301,B00IT5L49E,G. Hearn,"[12, 27]","If you're looking for a ""real"" vacuum cleaner, then this is NOT what you want and I would advise you to keep searching.  This item is really more of a lightweight item for quick clean-up of little spills.  And if that's what you're in the market for, there is a MUCH better option (Electrolux) shown below at a MUCH better price.Here's what makes me not like this Hoover cordless:#1.  Lacks suction.  This is the #1 thing that a vacuum cleaner must have.  Suction!  Without good suction, it ceases to be a vacuum cleaner. The box shows that it's supposed to be ""full size"" and ""full power"".  I don't believe either of these are true.  For my ""regular"" vacuum needs, I use a ""canister"" vacuum.  I find that a ""canister"" vacuum has more power / suction and can be used on any floor surface. . . as well as other things like curtains, furniture, etc.  I don't know if the Hoover corded models have more suction than this cordless model, but I would hope that they do.#2.  ""Cleaning Wand"":  Look closely at the side view picture.  To use the ""cleaning wand"" you must first unhook the hose at the very bottom where it attaches to the base/brush part.  Look slightly above and you will see that there is a ""round part"" where the hose goes through to keep it attached to the machine.  There are several problems with this.  First, the hose itself is VERY cheap.  It so thin it almost feels like plastic wrap.  There is no way it's going to last very long.  Second, it stretches only a VERY short distance.  Third, because of the ""round part"" that I mentioned previously, where the hose goes through, you have to unplug it from the bottom. .  .then pull / stretch it up so it can be attached into the handle. . . . and when you do that, it's bending right where that ring is (""round part"") on the back of the machine.  This causes the hose to not be able to be stretched very far, but also I'm 99% sure after you've used this a couple of times, the hose is simply going to burst right where that part is located.  The overall ""craftsmanship"" is CHEAP.#3.  Attachments???  Though the booklet that comes with the machine shows several ""accessories"" this machine only comes with a couple of them.  The ""main"" one is the ""dusting"" tool shown in one of the pictures.  Fortunately I have a ""real"" dusting tool with my ""real"" vacuum cleaner. . . because this one is not it.Is there anything I like about this item you might ask?  Well, I like the fact that it's cordless. .  ..  but a vacuum with no suction. . . cordless or not. . . . is not a vacuum at all.If you're looking for a ""quickie"" vacuum cleaner that you can do a quick run over your floors. . . . or to a quick pick-up . . . .. that's also cordless.  . . .Then I recommend you have a look at the Electrolux shown below.  It's a two-in-one item.  You can use it ""tall"" or you can pop-out the hand-held vacuum as well.  It's a no-nonsense great little item to have when you don't want to haul-out your ""real"" vacuum cleaner for a small job.Electrolux Ergorapido Brushroll Clean 2-in-1 Stick/Handheld Vacuum 12V Cordless, EL1061A",1.0,A lot not to like.

The motors are on the BOTTOM and cannot leak oil into your food! Another plus for having the motor on the bottom, there is no struggle peering around the motor when adding ingredients to a running mixer. These brands also can take blender or food processor attachments. I tried the Electrolux (I didn't like the bowl design on the Bosch, but it doesn't bother Bosch owners). It is fabulous.

I own theCuisinart GG26-30H GreenGourmet Hard-Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch Stir-Fry Wok with Glass Coverand it is absolutely wonderful, so I figured I was safe ordering this pan. Wrong!!Let me tell you, I have been cooking for 30 years. I know how to care for my pans. I don't use cooking sprays of any kind. I don't put oil in cold pans to heat. I don't put my pans in the dishwasher. I don't wash them when they are hot. I don't use metal utensils. I don't do any of the things known to damage non-stick pans. Yet despite my knowledge and care, this pan was useless by its THIRD use.The first two uses went fine. Cleaning the pan was simply a soapy sponge. Then I decided to sear a seasoned skirt steak. The steak came out great, but the spices and olive oil were stuck to the pan. I soaked the pan in hot, soapy water for a couple of hours thinking it would come right off. It didn't. I had to scrub and scrub this pan just to get the crust off. Of course the next time I used the pan to saute some Mahi Mahi (again, in olive oil) the fish stuck to the pan, and I was barely able to save it. I just processed my refund and can say I will likely not purchase another skillet from Green Gourmet. How can two products by the same company have such dramatically different results?Edited to add: I neglected to mention that I seasoned my pan after that intensive scrubbing according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and it clearly had no effect as witnessed by my almost destroyed fish.",1.0,Extremely disappointed,1366156800,"04 17, 2013"

I bought this machine at Wal-Mart (about $30) to clean up the dried stain. In less than 10 minutes of use, I discovered several things:1) The *scrub brush* doesn't run when used on the carpet so you end up manually scrubbing with the device.2) You use more elbow grease manually scrubbing with this device than scrubbing with a 97 cent scrub brush.3) The tank rubs on the floor while you're attempting to use this, so whatever stain you are trying to clean up ends up all over the underside. If you then set this down on furniture or another area of carpet, you end up with a much larger mess than before you began.4) When the machine has a fine layer of moisture (about 20% full) in the holding tank, it begins SPEWING the dirty water out of the vents.5) When then attempting to dump the tank of dirty water, it takes a contortionist to dump the container without spilling any of it - and to completely empty (I still wasn't able to get mine completely empty)6) The clean water sprayer doesn't really spray - it sort of spurts each time you press the trigger.  I had more success with a spray bottle and a  small glass of water.All in all, it took me 10 minutes on the first stain to realize this was a piece of junk.  It then took me 30 minutes to clean up the unit to be able to return it to the store.  The second stain?  Cleaned up within 5 minutes of spraying Resolve carpet cleaner, lightly scrubbing, then soaking up the moisture with an old towel then tossing it into the washer. Btw, I then had to use this same method to finally clean up the first stain... and it took longer since the Spot Scrubber hadn't really removed any of the moisture from the carpet from the first attempt at cleaning the stain.

Yes, I go over every transaction and enter them in a spreadsheet. etc.Now, the fan.  If I were to return it a new one would cost me the price, which has increased, plus the restocking fee and of course I expect it to break in the same way.  As to the old fan, it's in that pile of broken stuff waiting to see if the switch can be super glued some way to hold it up so it can be pressed to start the fan with the outside button.  There's really nothing to glue it to since it was a pretty big chunk of plastic that broke of inside but who knows.  I tried a piece of tape but that doesn't work.I did call amazon and complained about unasked for refunds being processed and to let them no that I wasn't bothering with returning this.

You pull on a rope that has a small handle on the end. In theory, this will start the spinner whirling, and soon you will have lovely, dry lettuce. In practice, there are several things that can happen, none of them very satisfying:*  You pull, and the rope spools out of of the inner mechanism, while NOT starting the spinning. You are left to rewind the rope that is hanging limply by spinning the top by hand and trying again.*  You pull, the spinner starts quite vigorously, and the rope is quickly reeled back in - dragging your hand involuntarily along. Watch out for your knuckles. You can either pull the rope by putting your fingers in the handle, or by grasping the exterior of the handle. Both are hazardous.* You pull, and the spinner works, reeling the rope in a less dangerous fashion.  But unless you are holding the spinner down hard with your other hand, the bowl now spins rather violently or ""walks"" across the counter.I had a friend try this salad spinner as well, thinking that perhaps that I just didn't have a feel for how to pull this. Maybe like starting an old lawn mower, there was a ""feel"" you had to have for it. NAW!  It's just a bad design - unusable - he had exactly the same issues.Other details - the manufacturer says you can use it to drain pasta, which I tried, and which was fine.

I have used one for about 4 years and the element just doesn't heat up like it did when it was new. So it is time to retire it. (I can relate.) I live on the 8th floor of a condo building.  Charcoal grilling is not practical.  The Griddler is a pretty good substitute. Addendum: I just received the Griddler and it has a couple of significant improvements. I have edited my review to reflect the new featuresFeatures you will like:(1) It cooks top-botton (illustrated) and it lays out flat.  So it makes grilled sandwiches, pancakes, burgers and steaks.(2) It has griddle settings (by temperature) for pancakes and sandwiches and grill settings (low, med, high, sear) for meats.(3) It had two reversible plates with two surfaces.  One is flat, for a griddle.  The other has grill ridges.  The plates snap in and out easily.  Unlike previous versions of the Griddler, each plate fits both the upper and lower unit.(4) Clean up is as easy as it can be.  The cooking plates snap out for cleaning.  They are coated with a non-stick surface, which greatly eases the cleanup job.  But some stuff still cooks on.  A hard plastic tool is provided that makes it easy to scrap off anything that sticks withoug damaging the surface.  Just keep after it and the plates will last a long time.(5) Grilling and griddling drips oil.  There is a built-in drip cup to catch it. Easy to remove and clean.(6) The sufaces are rectangular, not round of oval.  I find this shape very practical.(7) Waffle plates are available separately.I think you will like the Griddler better than other electric grills.

I liked the looks of it - we got the black with stainless steel.That said, I would never have paid any amount of money for this. The first one broke within a week. It worked for a few days. Then, the coffee came out cold. Then, it stopped working completely.Gevalia sent a free replacement (the guy on the phone admitted, off the record, that these things break often). They didn't need the old one back, so I opened it up to see if it could be repaired (a hobby of mine).No surprise that ALL the parts came from Asia. I also discovered that BOTH the pump and the heating element broke, separately. So even if I fixed/replaced the pump, the coffee would still come out cold. This is quite amazing to me, since my previous coffee maker still works after nearly 20 years, and after having been dropped many times. Oddly, the wiring was sturdy & just fine (side note: a high percent of appliance problems/failures are simply frayed wires, which can be easily mended with electrical tape, even by a novice, in under 5 minutes).The replacement unit came & works (almost 2 years old now). But I still have major problems with it:Pros:* Stainless/black steel looks sleek* Digital clock* Auto-shutoff* Reservoir float indicator is niceCons:* ""Pause & pour"" does NOT work well. Only works 50% of the time, again, due to bad design. The rest of the time it makes a huge mess. This was the case on both my units.* The stainless finish gets dirty easily* There is no backup battery, so the clock resets every time you unplug the unit.* The pump will definitely not last long - it's overworked due to poor design/layout.* Because it's a top-load pump & filter, the steam comes up through the top. You cannot change the filter for 20 minutes, without risk of scalding yourself. It would be very difficult to make 2 consecutive pots of coffee (i.e., if you have guests). Plus, the excessive steam warped the cabinets above the unit.* The worst problem - the reservoir is only about 1"" in diameter. It's impossible to load it without spilling.-> Bottom line: Looks nice, but I've never heard of such a difficult, problematic coffee maker.

A1ZH5ULI4SBO48,B0055UZEAQ,"S. G. ""s.g.""","[10, 10]","I am a vacuum cleaner fiend. I spend a large part of each day cleaning. A good vacuum is one of the most important tools of my trade. I own a Kirby Ultimate G, Electrolux Green, Black and Decker stick, and Oreck upright. When I saw this vacuum cleaner I thought it might be even better than my favorite-- the Electrolux Green. The only reason the Eletrolux Green could ever be surpassed is because it does not have a beater brush.I really wanted a light-weight, quiet, bagless vacuum that would do a good job on carpet AND tile. My Electrolux Green does the ultimate job on tile and it's so QUIET!!! But it only does an okay job on carpet.Well, this Hoover does a GREAT job on carpet. The beater brush definitely makes this a superior carpet vacuum cleaner. I had been using my $1500 Kirby to vacuum all our carpeted rooms. It weighs about 40 lbs and is a real pig to haul up and down stairs. I always thought the Kirby must be doing a good job because it was so obnoxiously huge and because, well, it's a KIRBY, for Pete's sake!! To make a long and disgusting story short, I could not BELIEVE the amount of hair/dust/dirt/schmutz there was in the Hoover cylinder after only one vacuuming. This Hoover sucks so hard it pulled my carpet up at the doorway transition. After only one vacuuming my carpets looked like they had been shampooed.  When it comes to cleaning carpet this vacuum cleaner gets a 10.However, it is heavier and louder than the Electrolux-- although still much less bulky than the Kirby. But, unlike the Kirby, you can also vacuum hard surfaces with it. It does a good job (not great) on my tile floors, but the large head is a bit difficult to get into narrow spaces like between walls and toilets. It sucks up nicely on tile floors and doesn't do the irritating spitting stuff out the back of the vacuum (like the Kirby does).This vacuum cleaner gets its highest marks when it comes to being bagless and easy emptying. You push one button to detach the cylinder and one button to pop it open and empty it. No fussing with bags, no paying high prices for bags.The only drawback in my view is the lack of suction when you detach the floor attachment from the handle. I was trying to vacuum up some dog hair in a corner that was stuck in a spider web. When I used the hand attachment it barely was able to suck up the old spider web.  This is unfortunate in that you can't use the vacuum cleaner to work on stuff like sofa cushions or cloth blinds-- in effect, you'd still need another vacuum cleaner for those tasks.It seems like there is no vacuum cleaner out there that will do everything. This Hoover is a great part of a 2 vacuum cleaner team. The way it cleans carpeting is absolutely amazing. Worth the money.UPDATE:10/9/11the vacuum cleaner stopped working a few days ago. When I had some time, I took it out and plugged it in again. This time, the vacuum cleaner worked when on ""normal"" but not when the multicyclonic button was pushed (or whatever the button is called that activates the beater brush in the vacuum head). I unplugged it again, looked at the beater bar, checked the belts, cleaned both canisters and checked out the cleanable filter (it wasn't dirty). I plugged it in again and this time the beater brush button worked but dust/smoke started pouring out the beater brush head.I called Hoover and pushed the key for the ""call back"" assistance. I waited until the next day before trying my hand on the product again.I pulled up the product online on the Hoover site. I took apart the vacuum cleaner piece by piece (not too tough because there aren't too many pieces). FINALLY, I took the handle off the beater brush head and stuck my finger into the beater brush. EWWWWWWW. There were multiple round balls of ick clogging up the beater brush head. It was gross, but I couldn't get it out with a pencil, sheet rock screw or anything other than my finger. I plugged it in, started it up, and STILL dust billowing out. To make a long story short, the entire handle, all the way to the floor, was stuffed with perfectly round hairballs. I guess the ""multicyclonic"" doohicky twists everything into perfect spheres.Lesson learned: absolutely empty the cylinder after each room-- not after each USE.The next day Hoover returned by call around 4 pm.This is one heavy unit, and the design of the canister (lots of angles) gets hung up on every piece of furniture in my house.This vacuum cleaner still cleans carpet better than any I've seen, but it is not easy or convenient to lug up stairs and room-to-room.December 9, 2011Today I carried the unit to my living room to vacuum and the bottom portion (the part that sucks dirt from the carpet) fell off and several wires were exposed. I wasn't carrying it in a weird way (there is only one way). We tried putting the suction portion back onto the handle and the handle cracked. We used bailing wire and duct tape (no kidding) but still couldn't keep it together. This seems a bit fragile after only a couple of months. This vacuum cleaner is a real let-down.

And then suddenly a couple of years ago I woke up one morning and realized that I hadn't had a cup of coffee in weeks.  I switched to a 4-cup coffeemaker (have yet to find a good one) and then various gizmos that make coffee a cup at a time.  The Melitta cone & filter is easy to use and great when made in the larger pot, but the coffee isn't as strong as I would like when you use the single-cup cone to make just one cup.

The center/cyclone design is really effective and results in the suction power staying strong even as it fills up. We have two large dogs that shed and track dirt into the house: a border collie and a lab. The pet hair never got tangled up in the front brush. Rooms smell fine after vacuuming; the air filter really seems to work well. One pass is fine for our floors, low-height and medium-height carpets. Removing, dumping out, and reattaching the dirt trap is pretty easy to do. It snaps back into place with a moderately solid feel.In summary: although it's mostly plastic, and some aspects seem wobbly, this vacuum does a great job, and is a pleasure to use.UPDATE:I was about to test it out on our staircase and discovered that the main roller wasn't turning. The handy belt window allows me to see that the belt isn't looking like it should - I can't really see it. So either it's slipped off whatever it's supposed to be mounted on, or it's snapped.

Roberti ""Ironpeddler""","[86, 87]","Let me start off by saying we have this set for 16 months now....the pattern is beautiful and everyone that comes to our house for dinner comments on how nice they are, but as most people have said, they chip very easily. We have spent OVER $800 on a service for 12, plus doubles in platters, serving bowls, the big pasta serving bowls, water pitcher, mixing bowl set, etc at the Company store (three 16pc. sets)and assorted pieces over the Internet...and 1/3 of them have assorted chips and cracks. We are NOT rough with these things at all, in fact we baby these things now...but God forbid something slips out of your hand, it's history! You have to be very careful not to have anything touch them in the dishwasher or there will be assorted chips out of all the items that came in contact...and this started from day one. I have replaced 7 pieces over the course of the year because of complete breakage! DO NOT buy the fluted edged pasta bowls, they are very fragile and chip if you just look at them! When we bought the set at the Pfaltzgraff store, they said they were dishwasher safe, that has since been rescinded because of all the problems with them. We had a previous set of dishes for 15 years and had 2 or 3 chips on the whole set...on these dishes we must have 25 to 30 chunks missing!...plus assorted cracks! Another reviewer mentioned the fact that they get hot in the microwave oven when you heat something in them and they were right on the money with their opinion....they are so hot after the cycle is done, you need a potholder to remove the dish, plus the food is not even heated! My wife wanted to bring these back to Pfaltzgraff after one week and I should have listened to her! What do you expect when this over-priced set is made in China! What a shame. I'll give them 2 stars because of the looks, but ZERO stars for durability = 1 StarUPDATE: 10-5-2007...I did a review earlier this year and I just had to update potential buyers, not about the dishes, but about the company Pfaltzgraff. Read the reviews, these dishes are so fragile they should be recalled by Pfaltzgraff, but they won't even address the problem, let alone deal with us customers that spent all this money...in our case, well over $800! It's now to the point (2 years) that we're considering buying another set of dishes because we are embarrassed to use them when we entertain. I have written 3 letters to Pfaltzgraff without a response...I have sent them 6 e-mails, without a response. I am VERY respectful to them, make no ultimatums, no threats, just a plea for help with THEIR product that is obviously improperly made. NO RESPONSE AT ALL! I have gone to 2 Pfaltzgraff Outlet Stores and the kind ladies in both said that a lot of their Chinese products are coming back chipped, cracked, and broken from just daily use and now they are instructed NOT TO ACCEPT ANY MORE RETURNS OR EXCHANGES ON THEM! Some company, huh?So this is a classic example of ""Buyer Beware"". Our money is too hard to earn to throw it away on a product such as this. Don't fall the beauty, this will happen to you too. I can't tell you how many times a guest at our home has dropped a fork or clipped a dish with their drinking glass only to have a CHUNK of Napoli fall to the table! Horrible.

A3PP8JH1CDB5Z3,B001RUS05E,edefatto,"[24, 27]","This unit does an incredible job of destroying odors. Unforunately the filtered air it puts out does not smell clean like the air that the cheap $45 Hamilton Beach 04383 put out. The Hamilton Beach model did not off-gas plastic like this one does. At first this unit put out a strong plastic smell--not PVC shower curtain or PVC air mattress strong, but very noticeable and bothersome-- but that dissipated to a more mild plastic stink after a about a week. It wasn't until after a few weeks of usage that the plastic smell became a background smell. This is totally unacceptable for an *air purifier*. For the price I was not expecting that at all.This unit is cheap and flimsy feeling, but I suppose helps in making it lightweight, which is nice, as it is simple to move from room to room despite its large size.NOISE: this unit on low setting produces very little of it. On the low setting the loudest noise it makes is from the ionizer-like function, which makes a staticky ticky-ticky sound. Not terrible, rarely annoying, and certainly tolerable. Overall the sound this thing makes is mostly just air movement sound and as long as you keep it on 2 or lower then it does not disturb much. Noisewise, this thing is excellent.I am certain this unit actually reduces my somewhat strong allergies (I am uber-sensitive to everything). I stopped using this for most of a week and my allergies came back with a wicked vengeance, and then after running this purifier for a day they died down remarkably well. Too bad about the plastic allergens it throws in my air.The biggest problem I've had with this is that it sometimes outputs a bizarre and terrible smell that I have never encountered before and cannot identify. Usually this smell only happens when I first turn the unit on and then it quickly disappears within seconds, but sometimes the machine steadily outputs this awful stench. I have no idea what that is about, but it is very unpleasant.Ultimately, this thing just does not output clean air, the air this unit puts out has an odd plasticky smell--at the very least, as often enough it outputs another stronger nasty smell that is literally nauseating. I feel this unit is not worth the price unless destroying offensive odors is more important to you than clean, fresh/neutral air. I am surprised the cheap, flimsy-filtered Hamilton Beach model offered a much more pleasant experience. After I can find a suitable replacement, one that does not off-gas or produce its own terrible stinks, I am going to dump this intoSalvation Army/Goodwill. I sooo wanted to love this thing.UPDATED: May 27th, 2013I found out where the nasty odor this thing emits is coming from: the motor.

Now that I have a daughter I need to be healthier for her. So basically my number one priority was to be healthier by buying this juicer.I bought this juicer based on the professional and consumer reviews.The reason I returned it was NOT because...It had a too small juice jugEven though it has a wide mouth there is a large plastic line that guides the pusher which inhibits to put whole produce like applesIt produced a lot of frothIt spread residues of pulp all over the kitchenIt had a too large pulp container with an uncomfortable shapeIt didn't have different speeds to make soft and hard produce.It was very loudNow the real reason I returned it was because...It blew up when I was juicing. All the parts flew over my kitchen table only remaining the base on place. My kitchen was a disaster zone full of pulp. I was very lucky it did not hit me. Remember the number one reason I bought this juicer was my health and I almost lost it because of this juicer. It is one horse power against me.I seems funny but it really is not.I just bought a Breville Fountain Plus juicer which has a much safer locking mechanism and fixes most of the things I didn't like about the Hamilton Beach except It yields a little bit less juice, it has just a little less froth and it is double in price.I am happy with the Breville juicer. I have lost seven pounds since I began juicing seven days ago; however I have been reading a lot about juice, nutrients and juicers and I think masticating juicers are better options.The advantages of masticating juicers like Omega over centrifugal juicers like Breville or Hamilton Beach are:They don't oxidize juice like centrifugal juicers do because of the lower RPM.The juice extracted taste better.The juice has more nutrientsNutrients last up to 72 hours in contrast to less than 24 hours in centrifugal juicers.They can do a better yield juicing leafy greens which contains the major quantity of nutrients.Noise levels are much low (I have a baby so I can not juice at night)Less frothThe disadvantages are:They cost a lot morePulpier juice.Slower to juice than centrifugal juicers.Some are bulky and heavy.Putting on a balance the advantages of masticating juicers over centrifugal juicers they are worth it. The only real problem is the price, but what is more important than your health?Finally I would advise people buying the Hamilton Beach juicer take into account the hazardous locking system this system has. I hope you do not have the same problem and  I hope this reviews helps. Actually for the price, the Hamilton Beach is a good juicer however I give it one star because I thing you buy this juicer to get healthier and for the bad locking system The Hamilton Beach juicer  put the person juicing in danger.Thanks",1.0,Fat Sick and Nearly Dead...

I guess I'll be the voice of dissent.For years, I have used basic/analog, small instant read thermometers quite successfully.  For steaks, I've always just gone by a finger touch but for pork and chicken, I like to be more careful.  Figured I'd give the digital a shot to see if it would be more precise and maybe just be more careful with my steaks too.  I have to say, I read in the product description that it takes 6 seconds to read.  Now I wouldn't describe that as &#34;ultra fast&#34; as the title says, or really any faster than any analog instant reads I have used.  In practice, without actually timing it, it felt much longer to get to a read to settle in than the analogs, whether that was six seconds or more or less.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt to some degree and credit some of that to it just being a more specific device than a needle on a dial.But the thing that really bugs me is that, in my experience, this thing was just flat out inaccurate.  I found myself cooking things longer than I was used to in order to get to the desired temp reading, only to find when the meat had rested and been cut, it was overdone.  I'm pretty religious about allowing resting of meats before cutting, it makes a huge difference as any regular griller knows.The straw that broke the camel's back was this past weekend, Father's Day.  I had four beautiful, 2-inch thick, prime beef filets to grill.  I trusted this thermometer and took those four steaks off at 120 - 122, but it took longer than I expected to get to that number.  I figured they'd rise a few degrees or so, but still be a nice medium rare.  Rested a good ten minutes.  Nope.  Barely pinked back up and were solid medium well.  That's ruined in my book.  I kind of gasped as I looked at the cutting board and my wife came over and kind of started to and said, &#34;wow, what happened?&#34;  I said &#34;thermometer lied to me.&#34;  To which she said &#34;why have you started using a thermometer for your steaks?&#34;  Good question.Had a few other similar experiences, which I won't bother to detail.  But I'm out on the digital thermometers, thanks to this one.  I'm going back to analog and just using the touch/feel method.

At first I thought that it was such a great set, with a normal lid for cooking and the pressure cooker lid for when I needed it. Well the first time we used it, we kept hearing popping noises and a plastic smell. We couldn't figure out what was going on. Now we have used it approximately a dozen times and we finally figured out what it was. On the shorter of the two pans, the plastic on both handles were starting to pucker and bubble from the heat. WHY THE HECK WOULD THEY MAKE A HANDLE OUT OF A PLASTIC THAT DOES NOT WITHSTAND THE HEAT OF COOKING? I do not know. So we contacted Fagor and received no response whatsoever.  In addition, I do not know what kind of finish or stainless steel they use but I have a lot of trouble getting it clean. I own a ton of stainless steel pots and do not have a problem getting cooked on food off the pan. The stainless steel on these pans, however,  are constantly are stained with burnt on food on the interior of the bowl. I normally use a regular scrubby sponge to clean out the inside. I switched to something more abrasive and it still does not fully get the blacken stains off the interior.Does it do what it is supposed to? Yes. This would normally for me warrant more stars than 1.

AWB2J9W15OT6I,B000E7YLJK,Mom2Three,"[0, 1]","The most expensive purchases we make for our homes are the items that sit in the closet and go unused. Case in point, this Eureka vacuum. I needed to replace a stick vacuum to use on a daily basis in the kitchen and laundry for my hard flooring surfaces. I have three kids and two cats, so I have crumbs, dust, furballs, cat litter. etc. After checking customer reviews, I decided on this vacuum - it seemed that it would fit the bill, and it was ""cute""  (which is very important, right?) The onboard tools seemed like they would be a good thing, and also, I wanted to get something at my local retailer so I wouldn't have to wait for shipping. Well, I got this thing home and took it out of the box. It was way cool - had to be great, right? WRONG.First of all, I turned it on, and it had to be one of the LOUDEST things in my home. As loud, or louder than my blender, for example. Not good. The head of the vacuum was too thick to fit underneath my kitchen cabinets. Strike #2. But the thing that got me the most was that the exhaust for the motor is right in front of the unit - it sits just above the head of the vacuum and blows hot air. If you are vacuuming carpet, this probably won't make a difference...but on my hardwood floor, it was blowing the dust bunnies and furballs out of the path of the vacuum as I came up to them. It was like chasing shadows. Impossible to catch them. Hard pellets like crumbs and cat litter wouldn't pick up. All in all, it was just not good for me. And it wasn't just me -- I had a friend who dropped by as I was cleaning, and I showed her the problems. She confirmed that the exhaust vent seemed to be blowing around the very things I was trying to pick up. It was very frustrating, because I've been using vacuums for 20+ years now - it's not that hard. And if you put your hand underneath to feel the suction, it was nearly non-existent. I checked it over to see if I had failed to assemble the three pieces properly. I hadn't. However, it seemed to do an adequate job on the area rugs, so rather than take it back to the store, I sent it upstairs to live with my daughter, where she could use it for quick cleanups in her bedroom on the carpeted floors. Still really loud, though. REALLY loud. Oh, and the cord is fairly short. I guess this sort of thing is relative - depends on how large your rooms are. For me, the cord was short.So even though the vacuum is not useless, it was not used for it's intended purpose, which means I spent another $50 buying what I should have bought in the first place - a Hoover Flair stick (my original one died after about 3 years of faithful service) - I had to wait a couple of days for shipping, but it was worth it, and now 18 months later I still have it and it works great.

I proceeded to remove the old disposer, then started installing the Waste King. It might have been very easy but for the fact that I have a cast iron sink, which is thicker than a stainless steel sink, and realized only after attempting installation that I would need an ""extended flange"", a part which needs to be ordered, is not available anyplace locally in spite of the fact that I live in a large metropolitan area, and costs over $25.00. There was no mention of this on Amazon's web page, and I think Waste King should provide the part that fits without adding on to the original price. They could package it differently and specify that it's for cast iron. I also think Amazon should take responsibility for not including a warning on the product information that it will not fit a cast iron sink without an extra part, which should then be displayed on the same page and included under Prime Shipping without jacking the price up to cover the shipping.  So far I'm not happy with this item, and I hope that when and if the part I'm paying over 25% more than the original disposer price for arrives, things will go better.I received the extended flange quickly, within a few days. The rest of the installation went smoothly. It's pretty much for nuthin', though, since this disposer will only chew things which are cut into tiny bits or julienned to a fine point and fed vertically into it. I get what the other reviewers meant about the small hole now. It's quiet, and it grinds things once it takes them, but it will not grab food that is not tiny already. I am used to a disposer that will grind watermelon rinds easily. Maybe the reason this one has no anti-jam wrench is because it will only take food that is slowly fed into it in tiny bits.

A10QUY14I0ZYFL,B000MDHH06,Ketty,"[3, 5]","Wow, I've used this machine for little over a week and I've found SO many problems with it!First there's a design flaw that might cause the machine to grind itself up! Let me explain.For those of you reading my review who has never owned a centrifugal juicer and don't know a how it might work, I think it'll help if I explain how this juicer works first before I attempt to explain the problems I've had with it. This juicer works like this. There's a base that houses the motor on the top of which there's this round knob thing (called the motor base in the manual). You stack the integrated pulp container (which is the shape of a donut or a bundt pan) on top, or rather, around the motor base. The pulp container does not spin since it sits around the motor base. Then you you align the metal mesh basket on top of the motor base which sits in the inner hole of the pulp container. To operate the machine, you put the lid on the pulp container, latch on the safety, and feed stuff down the chute on top of the lid. The basket has sharp grater teeth and two small blades in the middle. It spins with the motor base. Whatever you drop into the chute gets ground up by the spinning teeth. The heavier pulp gets flung to the side and into the pulp container, the small pieces of pulp gets filtered by the mesh basket and juice falls through the holes to the bottom and out through the juice nozzle. Now this is all pretty cool how it works except the parts are stacked on top of each other very loosely! There's some wobble/give to the position of the pulp container as well as the metal basket.  This caused my unit to misalign during operation and parts started grinding up on each other.I've only had my juicer for 3 days and I have been putting it to heavy use juicing anything I can find: carrots, celery, citrus fruits, ginger (for ginger syrup). I even attempted sugarcane. I found out that the juicer juiced citrus fine, but juicing hard veggies, especially the sugarcane was scary. The hard fibers from the plants clogged up the mesh filter and every time I tried to push the pieces of sugarcane in, the machine made banging noises. I thought the plastic housing was cracking at the time but I think the banging came from pieces of pulp getting flung onto the housing of the machine. Nonetheless it was scary. After juicing about 3 inches of sugarcane, I took off the mesh filter basket to clean the fibers off of it and to empty the pulp container. I discovered that the inner rim of the plastic pulp container had a scrape mark around 1/4 of the circumference. It appeared during operation, the accumulated pulp offset the balance of the machine and the metal basket ended up scraping against the inner rim of the pulp container. The metal filter basket is not suppose to be touching the pulp basket at any point but some how mine did and little chunks of plastic were scraped off!  I now fear getting burnt plastic powder in my juice.Other than this major hazardous flaw, the little pieces of pulp debris would fly out of the chute while I try to juice my veggies. You can prevent debris from flying every where by using the food pusher to block the opening but there's no way you would be able to plug the chute fast enough. I also found the juicer did not do a good job juicing overall. There were little pieces of fibrous grit in my juice, and was not happy with how there was still too much juice left in the pulp.Overall, this is just not a good system for pure, sanitary extraction, because you will get grit, flying pulp, and maybe even part of the machine, falling through the cracks and crevices between the stacking components. The filter basket as well as the plastic parts also seem very fragile . The filter basket itself is $45 to replace, not worth it for half the price of the device.I'm returning this unit and getting a more expensive one. Plastic parts not worth it.Update Feb 4, 2013:I continued to use this machine (despite the scraped plastic part since it only did that once) while I'm waiting for myOmega J8006 Nutrition Center Juicer - Black and Chrometo ship. I've realized I definitely don't like this machine AT all and definitely will return this thing for the following reasons:--It's loud. It sounds like you're running a hair dryer.--Compact?? Not really. It takes up the same space as a bread machine or a food processor.--Juice fountain? More like pulp geyser! It's super messy! If you're juicing little pieces of fruit that will fall through the chute, stuff will fly EVERYWHERE as soon as it lands on the spinning mesh basket. Yes you must have the machine running while dropping food in there. For example, I tried juicing strawberries, the berries bounced right out of the chute. The only way to prevent this is if you pack stuff into the chute first and then slowly push it down. That's way too much work and also impractical for small things like berries.--Depending how fast you put stuff down the chute, the machine might move itself because of the motor, causing you to spill juice everywhere.--Forget about juicing soft fruits. This machine will waste it all. I juiced an entire pineapple and ended up with 1 quart of juice and the pulp had the consistency of slurry! What a waste! Same with strawberries, wasted 2 containers of strawberries just to get 1 pint of juice. 8 pounds of oranges produced 2 quarts of juice and semi-dry pulp. Really a waste.--Too much foam in the juice, even more waste.--Clean up is a hassle because of all the mess. You have to rinse the lid, scrap out the pulp container, brush particles off of the mesh basket, wipe the base of the unit (which has an annoying hard to reach spot right under the spinning knob), AND wipe up your whole counter because stuff just flew everywhere. Sure you can put it all in the dishwasher but the pieces are big and top rack only so it'll take up the entire top rack.--The base unit gets really dirty and has that crevice under the spinning knob, but you cannot submerge or rinse or do anything to really clean except wiping it with a damp cloth since it houses the motor.Yeah, save yourselves the disappointment and get the Omega masticating juicer instead. From what I can tell, it's quieter, easier to clean, safer (no fast moving blades), doesn't fling stuff EVERYWHERE, juices leafy greens, makes sorbet, and comes with a 15 year warranty. I got my Omega on sale (not from Amazon) and it only costs about $150 more. The $150 can EASILY be saved from NOT having to buy extra produce because of less waste when you're juicing. I will update once I get my Omega what the difference is.",1.0,"Assembly is shoddy at best, fear of little plastic pieces in my juice! Also doesn't work very well..messy.",1359244800,"01 27, 2013"

I've thus far gone through bread knives from Victorinox and Wusthof Gourmet. The Shun classic bread knife is already showing signs of wear and being serrated I can neither hone nor sharpen the knife myself. In my mind I went from &#34;knife&#34; to &#34;saw&#34;, found this item and decided to give it a shot.First, I found the whole thing to be ergonomically incorrect. I'm right handed with my thumb being much more powerful than my other fingers. I would much have preferred if the blade came facing the other direction. But if you do that, then you have to start cutting the bread from the left side rather than the right side due to the wooden shape which again, doesn't work well if you're right handed.The blade is held on with two screws, one on each end. The screws on mine were sloppily inserted at different angles. As I made my first slice, the blade creaked and the whole thing felt like it was trying to burst open. Between that and the blade being thin it left my bread torn and jagged. Reaching the end of a slice, I could not finish the slice cleanly because my knuckles knocked onto the counter and I couldn't just lift my wrist and tilt the thing to finish the slice the way I can w/ a normal bread knife.Two slices afterwards, this thing landed in the trash.

I've tried a lot of things to get it to go back to normal without success.  I've changed my rating from five stars to one star and can no longer recommend this shaker since it lasted for only about a year.  It looks and feels like a high quality product.  I hope they fix this defect.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've had this shaker for about six months now and only had good experiences.  Because the lid is plastic, I do not put that part of it in the dishwasher.  To me dishwashers wreak havoc on all plastics, even if they say dw safe. It could be a key to my success with this one.THE GOOD:*  The lid is plastic and not stainless steel.  When a two piece stainless steel shaker gets stuck together from the cold, it is difficult/ almost impossible to get them apart. This shaker doesn't have that problem. The plastic top with the stainless steel bottom is perfect.*  You have to give it an extra hard click to get the straining part shut.  (Still one thumb though) It gives me confidence that it is really closed.*  I can shake it really well and I've had no fears of it leaking.*  The threading to put the top on the base is in alignment, so it doesn't give me any trouble putting the lid on.*  It only has two parts, the lid and the base.  - No need for extra pieces, a drink strainer etc.*  The base is stainless steel and thick for a nice chilling effect withour freezing your hand off. (Other shaker materials like glass or plastic don't chill as quickly or as well and just melt your ice)*  It Mixes two good sized martinis at once.THE TRICKY:*  The lid can be a little tricky to clean, especially if you have citrus bits in it.  It has a unique strainer design.  I drop some soap in it though and put it under high pressure water at all angles to get the inside and the strainer part clean.*  The harder click to snap the strainer lid closed is a plus for me, but if one wasn't expecting to have to do that, it would defintely be tricky as your drink will leak out if not closed all the way.*  The drink doesn't pour out of the strainer as quickly as it does with the old fashioned strainer, but I'm used to it now.This has now become my new hostess gift.",1.0,USED TO BE Favorite shaker for chilling libations!,1272585600,"04 30, 2010"

A14Z9GWMW7GIRS,B00006JSUA,Ken Bates,"[32, 64]","I own a well seasoned steel Wok, 2 cast iron griddles and one small #3 Wagner cast iron skillet. I do not have to pamper these treasures. Just some coarse kosher salt and cold or hot water removes any oils or sticky sauces.The box that contained the Lodge skillet felt light. The factory packed inner box had a label that said 12."" However, when I opened it my concern was realized. There was a 10"" pan inside. The replacement came quickly and I am supposed to get a credit for my shipping costs.I augmented the alleged ""pre-seasoned"" lodge skillet in the manner I was shown by a chef who was trained by the renowned French chef Escoffier.  The technique is simple. Moderate heat and Crisco solid shortening applied with bunched wax paper. The wax may even abet  the Crisco but the reason it is used is that no cellulose fibers will be incorporated into the shortening patina. Using a paper napkin or towel or cotton cloth will place fibers in the patina and they will create a place for food to adhere to.A teaspoon of Canola (Rapeseed) oil was put in the hot pan and then an egg followed. The egg stuck better than Crazy Glue and this did not surprise me, as I was suspicious of the pan when I saw it had a surface that looked like it had actually been cast in sand (which is still a way to cast iron.)My old, above mentioned, treasures all have surfaces as smooth as a baby's bottom. They are a joy to work with. This pan is a joke. After the abyssmal performance I felt I had nothing to loose by messing with the surface so I tried to smooth out the pebbled (sand cast) surface but gave it up as I lack the proper materials to do so.Nonetheless, I think I may have abraded the so-called pre-seasoned surface enough to lay down my own patina that may smooth out with constant use. Otherwise, I will just use the skillet for frying things other than eggs or pancakes, etc. I saw a similar pan in large chain retailer for less money.A few days after posting my 1 star review I scrubbed the surface and seasoned the pan in a manner similar to that used by an earlier poster. I added Crisco and put in a hot oven. My wife got hot under her collar when the house was full of oily fumes.So I did not cure it for the full 40 minutes.I put the pan in my outdoors gas barbeque grill upside down and closed the cover. A hard patina formed. After a few times of gently warming on the gas stove using a diffuser I gave it a whirl with another egg. This time the pan was not very hot. After flipping the egg over on its yoke I was able to to slide it around like a hockey puck on ice. I had spread almost 1 teaspoon of Canola oil followed by a pat of butter.I am now a happy camper. I recommend this pan even though the cooking surface is not evenly flat and mine had a crease in it as well.I purchased my first Teflon pan in 1970 and it performed awesomely for almost 10 years. This was inexpensive and you could fry an egg without any oil. I gave it up after a good deal of the coating had peeled away. I have never seen a coated pan that performed as well as the first one I purchased. I am sure that companies stopped using that specific very smooth coating by 1980. I just tossed a coated Calphalon skillet that started to stick after 3 years of careful use. My wife would not let me use anything but a special plastic spatula or wooden spoon so it was not abused.Ken BatesBoston",1.0,EDITING MY OPINION TO 4 STARS,1164844800,"11 30, 2006"

A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B005FSRF6E,Chandler,"[9, 12]","I am the victor of kitchen gadgets. I never met one I didn't have to have. I love to cook. The kitchen is my kingdom.My husband knows this and being the sweet man that he is, he often comes home with something he has noticed I don't own yet in the kitchen.Here is where we shop differently. I, 99 percent of the time, look, up the item on Amazon first to see if it tickles my fancy review-wise, not just visually. He, on the other hand, buys it, no questions asked. He has actually scored some sweet things I love and the fact that I am surprised weekly at all he thinks I might enjoy (the florist, for example, likely thinks I have a terminal illness due to all the flowers he gifts).But this was a two-thumbs downer.It is true that due to my gadgetry love I keep all I can off the countertops. While I have a huge kitchen out of sheer necessity from the shopping monkey who resides on my back, I also have things like a latte maker, a pasta maker, an electric icecream maker etc on top. And I hate clutter. These are used often and they are heavy so anything little at all goes in a drawer or cabinet so that I actually have only a handful of things that can be seen while the rest of kitchen wizardry is put away until needed.So here is where the thought behind this purchase comes in. Husband knows I don't want an electric can opener as that would be ON the counter. Husband knows I love gadgets. Husband knows I use an old-school can opener. He is in Bed, Bath, & Beyond.Hence I own this gadget which at first looked to be a fine candidate for my collection of all things kitchen.Ah, dear can opening shopper, that is where you would be wrong.Here's the thing. Should you ever cook with anything in a can that involves a liquid, pass it up. You don't have to read that sentence again, I'm looking at you enchilada sauce, the liquid in beans every recipe tells you to drain and rinse off, pasta sauce, soup...yeah, those canned items there. Basically everything in a can.Why? Because this cuts off the top lip of the can. The top lip that holds the liquid in as most gadgets remove the inner lid. This cuts right through the outer lid too so you cut lower into the can. This means the liquid isn't held in and this means my sparkly clean kitchen, EVERY time I use this gets a lesson Jackson-Pollock-abstract-splatter-art style. The thing that makes it more like a sport than a can opener, however, is that once the liquid starts spilling everywhere, the darn thing 90 percent of the time won't STOP. There is no stop button and you are watching the liquid spill and it's clamped onto the can and you can't unclamp it or stop it and it moves more slowly than the grandma on the AT&T; commercial whose grandson wants to tape a cheetah to her back...you get to watch messes be created in slow mo.Which brings me to my second point of contention. This thing needs a Cheetah taped to its back to make it work. My hand can opener is honestly about 6 times faster, cranky cranky away. I recall making a recipe where I was adding enchilada sauce and the pot was really hot and I needed to dump my liquid in quick and I had to sit and watch it scorch as I couldn't pull my hand away from this beast due to the spillage and I didn't have a spare cheetah to make it run faster. It's kind of like having a sous chef on a cooking show who was one of your rivals earlier in the competition and they remain bitter for being eliminated but they stuck him on your team when you were a finalist just for good TV drama and you have to watch him undermine all your good dishes.Yes, this is the One Touch.So when it does remove the lid you think to yourself ""Oh how lovely, there are no sharp edges"" as you gingerly run your fingers along the can lid like some Price Is Right hostess. But look further, dear daytime hostess....look at the CAN. What happens is when you spend an hour removing the dang lid, it rips off part of the can top and tucks it under the can lid. That part of the can that used to hold the liquid in on the CAN part, mind you. Then look at the can that's left. That sharp edge is right there on the top of the can now. The can that really needed that lip that is now under the can lid in order to hold in the liquid that is now spillage you are stepping in all around your cooking area. Yeah, that stuff.And did I mention it's hard to remove from the can? This really isn't that much of an issue because after you use it twice you'll be using another can opener anyway. Unless you only use it to open good solid pack things like dog food or spam or something. And if that's all that is in your kitchen, you have far greater probs them a One Touch, so crank away.Just because it has batteries, my can loving friend, does not a better can opener make. Go old school. Do your floor a favor. Unless you just don't know what to do with all that extra time on your hands lately...this does make you stand there forever wishing it would just be DONE already.It has that going for it.I haven't told my husband this.

I kept telling myself you get what you pay for. Well, tonight I want to cry because I had just started a pork roast to cook overnight. After leaving the kitchen, my husband and I both heard a loud pop. I went back and found my slow cooker leaking liquid all over the place. I took out the crock, turned it upside-down and found a winding crack all along the bottom.I've only owned my KitchenAid slow cooker for about 2 weeks and the crack occurred during the third time I used it. At this point I don't know if I want a replacement slow cooker directly from KitchenAid or whether I want to return the slow cooker to Amazon for a refund. If I got a replacement, I would be nervous to leave it on overnight or when I leave home, which is the whole benefit of having a slow cooker.

Living in Hawaii, I have easy access to excellent fresh pineapple. After 30 plus years of cutting up the fruit, I've developed a quick method for getting the job done--but it IS somewhat messy to do. (Also thought it would be neat to have the option of using the shell to serve dessert or a drink.)BUT it totally mangled the fruit! In retrospect I might have anticipated this, for the following reasons:1. The cutters all are plastic, and using them to cut a fibrous fruit--and the even more fibrous core--is similar to using a plastic knife in lieu of a real steak knife: It can be done, but it's an effort.2. Yes, I tried each of the cutters. All had the same sized core-removal portion, which is way too small for the pineapples I buy here; only the outer diameter on each of the cutters varies.3. Not only does this gadget assume that the core will be relatively small, it assumes that it will be VERY straight and very centered--a mistake, for the core often is slightly off-center and often widens near the base.After ten minutes, I gave up on this gadget and did what I normally do: Got out two cutting boards (one for the cored wedges, one for the original fruit, then used my trusty 20 cm (8 inch) Wusthof Trident serrated bread knife in the following steps.1. Cut off the prickly top of the pineapple with a margin of 1/2 to one inches2. Cut a slice off the bottom, with about the same margin. These two cuts give you a nice flat end, top and bottom.3. Cut the pineapple first into quarters, then into eighths4. Remove the core from each wedge (easily visible from the side) by standing it on end and slicing it top to bottom5. Remove the outer pineapple &quot;skin&quot; and &quot;eyes&quot; by standing each wedge on end and slicing off 1 cm (3/8 inch) of the outer skin. This is the trickiest part, learning to cut along a gentle curve.The resulting product is 8 tidy wedges, which you can slice up or serve individually. They are great in fruit salad, make awesome additions to kabobs--if they last long enough. From our pineapples, I generally have a yield of three pint containers of sliced fruit per pineapple.In summary, until Vacu Vin comes out with a metal version, and addresses the core size issue, my advice is to save your money and put it towards a really good serrated bread knife, such as the Wusthof Trident. In the end it will get you as much as 50% more fruit and you'll have a knife that will give you years of service.However, if you are totally dedicated to getting a shell from your pineapple, chat up the bartender or manager in one of those bars that sells tropical drinks with umbrellas and ask them where to buy a metal corer.

It would help if it were a bit further towards the front as I have to shift my hand to the side and bend the thumb to fool with the stupid speed.  In addition  changing the speed requires that you keep punching the stupid touch pad.. several motions instead of ONE.. carpel thumb if you plan to use it a lot.  My old mixer has a simple ribbed thumb slide which works with one motion and does not require shifting your grip.  Some engineer must have thought a touch pad was a good idea.

I laughed and told my wife she must have run the grinder twice. A few days later I ran the grinder and it produced FOUR TIMES the amount of coffee it was set for. Then it ran okay awhile, until a couple of weeks ago, when it just stopped working. I checked the collection bin switch and it seemed okay, but I don't know where the coffee bean bin switch is.

A3DQWFWINN3V5A,B00GCS37AY,David A. Lessnau,"[284, 335]","I bought this Nutribullet Pro 900 from Amazon as a Christmas present for my wife back on 07 December 2013 (sold by Speed of Light Distributors).  It was delivered quickly, but then sat under the tree, unused, until 26 December 2013.  Initially, my wife enjoyed it quite a bit.  But, on 10 January 2014, after about 10 uses, the gasket ring on one of the blade assemblies came off.  Thinking it trivial, we didn't think too much about that.  But, we noted that the manual specifically states that the gasket ring should not be removed and if it does come off, we should contact the company for a replacement blade assembly.  My wife confirmed that statement by asking on their Facebook page and they told her how to contact support.  She emailed support, told them the story, and gave them a copy of Amazon's invoice.  Today, Nutribullet emailed back and told her they wouldn't honor the warranty because the seller (Speed of Light) isn't an ""authorized vendor."" They told her she could buy a replacement at full price.  Needless to say, we declined their offer and are returning the unit to Amazon (even though it's beyond the normal Amazon 30 day return period, it appears that Amazon will allow her to return the broken unit for a refund).  So, here I am with a review.Now, on its own, the above is reason enough never to buy anything from Nutribullet LLC.  But, on the off chance that you poo-poo that statement, here are some comments on the Nutribullet Pro 900, itself.  Due to the joy of the holiday spirit, I paid way too much for this:  about $190 (it's much cheaper now).  Prior to the Nutribullet, my wife was using a $40 Oster blender to make smoothies.  From the glowing reviews here (including reviews that said the Pro 900 version was wonderful for blending ice and frozen fruit), I assumed the almost-five-times more expensive item would be better than the cheaper item.  Well, it's not.  Though the Nutribullet does handle frozen materials, it does it no better than the old Oster:  in both units, the frozen stuff wants to sit in one congealed blob and not blend.  She had to fight with it just as much as she did before.  For fresh fruit and vegetables, the Nutribullet works fine.  But, if it works any better than that $40 blender, it's a subtle difference.  The one good thing about the Nutribullet over the Oster is that it seems just a tad less noisy:  perhaps the difference between a jack hammer and a jet engine.I'd also like to note that the Nutribullet comes with a boat-load of documentation.  Unfortunately, 99% of it is, essentially, infomercial fluff.  Plus, the tiny bit of actual information in that documentation seems to be wrong.  The thing that immediately leaped out at us (besides failure to honor the stated warranty after about two weeks of use) is that the manual specifically states that you shouldn't fill the cups beyond the fill-line.  Yet, that fill-line is approximately at the 2/3 level.  Trying to follow the included recipes, my wife found that she couldn't fit half the materials specified into the cup.  After consulting the Nutribullet Facebook page, she determined that it's the added fluid that should stop at the fill-line.  The solid material could go up to the top since it will blend down to a fraction of its size immediately after the unit is turned on.So, there you have it.  An infomercial level of equipment and documentation, breaks in a way specifically warned of in the manual after 10 uses, refusal to honor the warranty after 10 uses, and works no better than a blender costing 1/5th as much.  I think that's definitely worth a Terrible rating of 1 star out of 5 and a warning to never do business with the Nutribullet company.My thanks to Amazon for allowing my wife to return this fine Christmas present I got her.",1.0,"Broke After 10 Uses, Nutribullet Wouldn't Honor Warranty",1389830400,"01 16, 2014"

A30Z0GG96D11EO,B001BFFVO8,Wisdom Twin,"[0, 0]","UPDATED 2/28/13:I can with all honesty and fervor say that I hate this machine.  The whole purpose why I wanted this canister vac was for the hose/power nozzle attachment.  The handle was bad enough, coupled with the fact that the hose twists into the oddest directions and makes it very difficult to hold.  I have now found that the hose does NOT suck up swept up piles of dirt like my old EXPENSIVE Dirt Devil from nearly 8 years ago would/did.  I have hardwood floors and rather sweep and suck up corners of dirt.  This garbage, literally pretends to suck up and when you move spits it all out.  I took apart the housing, canister and attempted to remove the hose from that darn handle to no avail.  There is no clog, yet this thing spits dirt back out.  When testing with your hand, there is suction, but yet not strong enough to pick up dirt.  I am starting to think that it is because of the heavy, clunky handle; it can not flow properly.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!  Stay away.I say ergonomic because of the shape you believe that it will be comfortable to maneuver.  Wrong!  We have had our vacuum cleaner for about 8 years.  It has seen a lot of dirt, hair and whatever 4 pets, 3 kids and 2 adults can throw at it.  As of today it still operates but different plastic parts have broken off and the filters are beyond being saved.  That is a machine that I would gladly re-buy today if it was still available.  This Dirt Devil; I would not.  Since moving into this apartment where there are hardwood floors throughout, I have wanted a canister vac where I could sweep the mess into the center and suck it up.  I find that vacuum cleaners tend to scratch the surface of hardwood floors.I was excited when I saw that the arm is telescopic.  I can reach the top of my curtains or cabinets if I desired.  Then came the part of putting everything together.  In my mind, starting from 5 stars, we were now on 4.  Detaching and reattaching is just a bit cumbersome at the end of the day.  For instance, when you attach the bottom to actually vacuum rugs, you not only need to fit it onto the telescopic handle, but you also have to plug it into the side of the canister.  My parent's old Eureka canister vac from the 80's was like this.  It is 2013, yet the styling and design mimics and is extremely reminiscent of the 70/80s.  That is not what I want in a household product.I loved the fact that you are able to tote along all the little attachments that inevitably disappear with other vacuum cleaners.  There is a small contraption that attaches to the telescopic pole.  The bad side to this is that it makes the handle just a bit heavier.  This is a bagless machine with a rather small canister.  The filter in the center of the canister CANNOT be washed.  It should be vacummed :) per their instructions.  There is another filter behind the mechanism that can be washed.  The light bulbs can be replaced on this model if necessary.  I experienced a bit of trouble when it came time to remove the canister and empty it.  You need to lift the top of the vacuum and press a button that will allow you to lift out the canister.  We lose another star, which brings us to 3 because the automatic rewind electric cord is only 18ft long.  My old model had a 24 ft one.  This is necessary for stairs.Finally we lose the last star because for my purpose this machine is just too clunky!  My husband, self and 10 year old daughter used it and came to the same conclusion.  The handle without the head attached is just too weird and large to lug around.  The handle is HUGE; so huge that I believe I would rather hold it from the pole.  It's not easy to maneuver around and then you find that the canister drags behind you.  When I attached the carpet roller piece, we used it on a rug that has not been cleaned in many months and had much litter on it.  It didn't do so great with the litter or pet hair.Do not recommend unless you go to your local store and actually feel the handle.  It's plastic and it's heavy.

I usually don't buy Dirt Devil brand but given the high price (hopefully denoting quality) and the energy efficient and AccuCharge features, I thought it sounded better than others.

I was amazed by its power.  The cup release is easy to press and empty.  The only learning curve was how to release it from the charging base and how to extend the extension device.I found it to be a miracle for my stairs going up to the 2nd floor.  I used to use a big vacuum for that and always risked my own safety.  It's also a wonder for my tiny bathroom (we're talking really tiny where a full size vac doesn't fit and I often got on my hands and knees with paper towel!).

I would say that you might be ok with occasional use (a few times a year).  If your animals get sick and you need to use it more regularly for a little bit, prepare to be disappointed.After the first few months, one of the tabs that holds the dirty water tank broke.  Not a big deal, as it doesn't appear to impact how it works.The connections between the clean water tank/shampoo and the nozzles have leaked since day one.  Not enough (at first) to worry about it.  It was initially enough to where I thought that was 'normal' due to the connection types.  There was always water/soap leaking under the unit after I turned it off.There were a few occurrences where the machine didn't dispense any water/solution to clean.  It took almost five minutes of going back and forth before it eventually worked.For some reason, everytime I filled the clean water, there appears to be shampoo in the tank and it foams up.  I have NEVER put shampoo in the clean water side of the tank.  There must be some internal mixing/backwash that gets back into the tank.If you are cleaning a large job, and need to empty the dirty water tank, expect the water to drip all over as you move the tank.  There are two 'external' places that it will come from as you remove the tank.  Two channels in the front, and a mesh piece in a corner.An inch-long plastic square rod (for lack of a better term) is all that rotates ALL of the bushes.  One piece.  It sheared off after a little over a year.  Hoover wants $35 for the replacement part, since I am 3 months out of warranty  I understand the concept of time-limited warranties.  This machine cost almost $200 when I bought it, and about $0.05 of plastic was its undoing.Overall, the plastic does not seem very durable for this machine.  We took very good care of this machine, and it did not return the favor.It was purchased in 1/2013, and died in April of 2014.  For almost $200, that is not acceptable.

ASG2MYT6412KD,B0051AQXZK,Ana Loggana,"[9, 33]","FINALE:  I wanted to post a video of me stabbing this mattress before dissecting it, but I was in such crippling pain I couldn't.  I took some pictures though.  In them you'll see the firmest piece of foam--the egg crate. And then two other layers of foam that I would effortlessly squeeze together flat with two fingers. Oh--one shown the torn latex--fragile stuff! Pictures do not include the latex topper because--oh wait--THAT is the latex topper?  Then what is in the cover which is covered on both sides?  Anyway, the pictures...  UH-OH.  No link.  TSK.  Will put on imgur--keywords DREAMFOAM Latex Mattress From Hell.  SO, are all three foams shown certified?  They'd each have to be.  The glue?  That would have to be.  The topper/top of the mattress--any other fabrics and foams would have to be to be called 100% certipur-us certified.  But I don't care anymore.  It's gone!!!!And for legacy...UPDATE #3 with most recent on top.  I see the comments are deleted now ? but somebody from DREAMFOAM or BROOKLYN BEDDING came in and said Brooklyn Bedding OWNS Dreamfoam so Dreamfoam has the certification I was concerned about.  I wrote certiwhomever to confirm and they didn't write back.  I told the rep if the certification place wrote back I would apologize.  I also asked him WHY Brooklyn bedding needs to have 2 companies if they are the same product.  But like I said the post was yanked.  Now there is a response by yet somebody asking for the apology but it's not coming from me.  I WILL SAY THAT NOW FINALLY DREAMFOAM IS LISTED ON THE SITE.So why am I suspicious?  Assuming you read my earlier reviews, I remain suspicious because these certs were on the Dreamfoam ads sometimes only.  I'm suspicious because Brooklyn Bedding, which held the cert, says it owns Dreamfoam.  I'm suspicious because Dreamfoam was not a listed vendor of the cert site.  I may have been the only person who bothered to look.  And I know there is a lot of abuse in the so-called Organic industry in general which is why I bothered to look.  Especially suspicious is that Brooklyn Bedding #2 (Dreamfoam) AIRS YOUR MATTRESS OUT FOR YOU WHEN THEY SHIP.  How nice is that?  Or is it because they need to?  And that cert was very important to me as a 9-11 WTC initial responder.  So important I was going to go with Brooklyn because they had the certs.  I suspect the unpleasant comments are got are from company sock puppets.  I suspect BB has two companies because they use one to pass of lower grade foam.The point of my review was to give people a heads up.  Clearly I'm not going to get a shut-up mattress from them. :-)I'm stuck with this for the time being.  The odor that smells like burnt hair or something is contained by my wrapping it up. The Dreamfoam medium plush is a saggy baggy even lumpy bed.  Looks it's a topper over cheap foam.  I will never consider such a bed again.I'm done with this topic.  Good luck!UPDATE #2. Came back to update:  Centipur-US does NOT have Dreamfoam as one of their approved vendors. I haven't checked the other certification yet and probably won't.INITIAL REVIEW: While emailing back and forth about the 100% latex (Brooklyn bedding at the time*)  I was fortunate, in a way, to get this mattress used from Craigslist for $140 with delivery.  Couple had it a few weeks and were given a Queen, they said.  I was desperate to get off mine and bought this as an interim.  It's the medium plush.It smells.  It is an unpleasant smell.  It is not resolving.  I don't think it is off-gassing (1.5 months or so now out of package) because it isn't irritating to my lungs.  And it sure doesn't smell like ""cookie dough"" as described on a review site.  (Search terms dreamfoam bad smell.)  It smells, right now, and it's a humid day so it might be worse in relative humidity.(*I went to Brooklyn Bedding because at the time I was looking at Dreamfoam they did not have those certification icons on their listing here.  That has since changed.)It isn't comfortable.  It's weird.  It feels like it wants me to go where it wants to go-- as if it wants to spring me back to another place.  There is no comfortable spot besides.  Imaging sleeping on a stale marshmallow.  I don't think a change in firmness is going to change my experience.I can't wait to get rid of this as the odor is unacceptable.I'm amazed but the reviews, frankly.",1.0,Wait 'til you see the best part--the eggcrate foam!,1376352000,"08 13, 2013"

Here is my experience... with two of them.My first was an Amazon Warehouse deal. It arrived jammed. By this I mean the burrs did not turn and no amount of cleaning would get them to turn, it just made a clunking sound and gave off a burning smell.I returned it and purchased a new one. From a conversation I had had with Breville customer support, I set the grind to maximum coarse, filled the hopper, and while grinding, turned the grind gradually to finest. In doing this, it did not jam.Then the fun began.Still got the burning smell. No, I was not using particularly oily beans. But the coarsest setting was far, far from French Press, fine even for Drip. And the finest grind was not fine enough for espresso. For 25 settings, there was very little change it ground consistency. The grounds were also not very uniform.Aside from the poor job this grinder does grinding coffee, it really is a nice grinder. Stainless Steel is nice. The hopper is very nice and does not let the beans pour out when unlocked, and comes with a very nice airtight lid. The LCD display is slick. There is a removable portion under the container held in with a magnet. The portafilter holders are also magnetic. The grounds container even has a plug to keep grounds fresh.So, I believe the good reviews here. I think those people (a) got a grinder that was assembled properly, and (b) are grinding for espresso.

I am so angry, I am writing this review at 4:30 am rather than wait until tomorrow so that I am clear on just how bad this is.I bought this rug just before an out of town guest was coming to stay with us because my usual rug in the bathroom was 2 years old and starting to show some wear. I thought it would be nice to have a cheap but new rug in there. Upon arrival, I was thrilled, and left it in its plastic when placing it on the floor because my guest was arriving 2 days later and I wanted it to be perfect and not risk having to wash it at the last minute. The day comes, I remove it, lay it on the floor that morning, and proceed to the rest of the house to do the last (and third) sweep/mop/vacuum jobs, making sure, as Grandma used to say "" if a penny rolls under the couch or a cabinet, your guest could reach under and get it AND COME OUT CLEAN"". I went into the bathroom 3 times during the day, in my slippers which were directly out of the dryer the night before!!! My husband went in there a few times also, in socks, no shoes.The last walk thru of the house found a bathroom rug that was FILTHY - A DARK BROWN, CHOCOLATE RUG THAT WAS SO COVERED IN TINY PIECES OF LINT THAT IT WAS EMBARASSING. No hairballs, no dust or dirt that I could see, the bare floor was spotless, the wood floor outside the bathroom was spotless - believe me, I swept and wiped it down with a wet rag thinking somehow the whole floor was not clean or I tracked something in there that I did not even see when cleaning throughout the day. I take it outside and give it a shake - nothing - its GLUED to the rug, or so it seems. I take out the little vac and instead of cleaning, everything that ever touched the little vac, was now on the rug-glued to it, or so it seemed-no reason to try the bi vac which just cleaned my entire house-that's for sure! This is now an hour later, trying to get it to look nice-I could have washed and dried it by now but it should just take a shake for goodness sakes-its a bathrug!So I put it in the laundry room and take out the old rug-which looks pretty darn good comparably.Now my guest is gone and tonight I decide I am going to wash the stupid rug.  But it occurred to me, whatever all this stuff is, it will be in my washer or on anything I wash with it, since it is so fiercely sticky. I decide I can get it off somehow.  I pull one piece off with my fingernail-lint I guess, not sticky at all-but since there's thousands, I cannot do it by hand.  I use the lint brush which works on everything - NO LUCK, IT REMOVES NOTHING AT ALL. So I get the lint roller, with the tape roll on it, I strip off the first piece and start with a fresh piece, it pulls up about half off what it rolled over, HURRAY! So I re-roll it, like any NORMAL person does, like I always do on my husbands dress pants or whatever needs it, and instead oF picking up the remainder, it actually REMOVES THE LINT FROM THE LINT ROLLER BACK ONTO THE RUG-SERIOUSLY, THIS IS NO JOKE.  Keep in mind, I am cleaning it before washing it so really this is un-freakin believable. Nothing I do except keep stripping off sheets and starting with new ones will work.  It took 14 new sheets just to get the lint off the front side of the rug, the first 8 inch strip of rug.  NOT THE WHOLE FRONT OF THE RUG, JUST THE FRONT FIRST 8 INCHES WIDE. So I start searching for something better and try packaging tape-no luck, medical tape, no luck, then I find another roll of lint roller tape which is a different brand from my older smaller lint roller and it feels heavier and stickier (EVERCARE is the brand-in case you have this dreadful rug) - it finally works, and although I still have to use a new sheet every time I roll it once or it will all come back off onto the rug again, at least it gets everything within the 4 inches or so that I roll it on, more or less.SO now I get to flip it over onto the other side and do it again on the backside - which lucky for me, is the same as the front side-YIPPEE.As it turns out, I could not let the ""clean side"" touch anything because it would pick up every invisible thing that exists in the world, so I had to awkwardly place my hand under it and press the lint roller tape against my hand with the rug in-between, so it took twice as long and by the end of this whole charade, I look at the clock and it is literally 3:30am, and I am switching my 4th load of laundry over to the dryer since I started this nightmare (obviously I started my laundry late tonight because I could not sleep). I SHOULD HAVE THROWN IT IN THE GARBAGE!I cannot imagine what it would look like if a family walked in and out of the bathroom for a week - or worse, what if my towels weren't a dark color like the rug? OMG SERIOUSLY, THIS RUG GOT THE BEST OF ME. what the heck did it pick up, just laying there for a few hours? Was it because my husband walks in there in white socks and so any lint on the socks stuck to it? Was it from my cleaning and there was some dust or lint floating through the air throughout the house and all of it magnetically ended up on the rug, but not anywhere else...like the black rug in the kitchen, the rug at the front door, the back door, etc? Since I was cleaning in furry fleece pj's, was I walking around with a cloud of fleece lint trailing behind me and I never knew until now?So its finally in the washer, all by itself, wasting water being washed alone, just as it wasted so much of my time, the cycle finishes, I go to put it in the dryer and just when I thought it was over....no, not lint, it is perfectly chocolate brown now....but it soaked up so much water it weighs about 10 lbs no idea how much it weighs actually), so 3 additional spin cycles later and hopefully the third extra spin is the charm.  BUT DO I DARE RISK THAT THERE IS LINT IN THE DRYER? Ugh, I haven't decided yet, but then, the third spin sycle isn't finished and it may need another, so I have plenty of time to decide what to do next.Even worse, if it's clean, I don't think I should put it on the bathroom floor again that's for sure.

The 1500 has been used mostly on my linen outfits to kill the wrinkles and avoid a full scale ironing. The more powerful one can remove some mold between tiles, but it is a tedious process. I found even it is inadequate to clean my barbecue or car tires.If you are like I was when I bought my first one steam cleaner, I thought it was a hot version of a PRESSURE WASHER. There is no real pressure here to clean. If you are cleaning outdoor items like engines and barbecues I highly recommend you buy a pressure washer.

I didn't have any pipe dreams about what it would do. Sadly, there is no power here and very little steam.The directions said it warmed up in 30 seconds and that the first time it is turned on it might not deliver much. I started it up and let it run for a good 10 minutes before trying it with the handles motor control all the way to plus. I got a little blast of steam that was only hot if you put your finger a few inches from it. I locked the trigger open and let it run in the sink for 10 minutes. No difference. I turned it off and tried it again several times on the first day I had it. It did the same thing every time. This morning I brought it up stairs to the shower curtain to see if it would work. We are talking about the kind of minor mold buildup between the folds that you can easily brush away with a towel. The only thing it removed was a streak I was able to effect by rubbing the plastic nozzle against the curtain. I decided not to test it on my clothes because unlike the higher powered 1500, it does not put up a real flow of steam. It spits and dribbles water and little clouds of steam which would lead to water spotting on your clothes. If you really want to see steam get the 1500.

AO9UNKQG83BUP,B003VFWWWU,Book Fan,"[12, 15]","I have been envious of all the interesting shapes of silicone baking pans in my nearby chef supply store, so was eager to try this one.First, some data.  Each mold is about 1/3 cup in volume (N. American cups; Australian cups are a different size), is just under 1 inch deep, and at the top the width is just over 1-7/8 inch and length is just over 2-7/8 inch.  The overall dimensions (11 inch by 10 inch) fit in my countertop oven.Cooking at 425, the overall size of the pan grew by about 3-4mm in both length and width, and since the rimmed tray I had it on was just the perfect size for it when cold, it had an undulating shape when I was through baking because it grew larger than the tray rims could contain.I followed all their first time use instructions:  They said to either rinse it under hot water or put it in the dishwasher.  I did both of those, after previously scrubbing it with suds.  They said to apply oil, I sprayed it with canola oil.  They said not to cook at hotter than 446 degrees, I put it in a countertop toaster oven at 425 degrees. I used a metal supporting tray.I made some moist drop biscuits and baked two in the two center molds (I put water in the remaining molds because it said not to put it in a hot oven when empty.  The biscuits rose nicely and had a nice crust, and they came out of the molds very easily.  But when I removed them, I got a strong whiff of warm rubber.  I tried eating some of the crust that had been touching the mold, and detected a faint set of of other tastes, possibly rubber (maybe I had olfactory fatigue after just sniffing the rubber fumes).  After letting the biscuits cool a few hours and trying them again, there was a definite rubber taste. (I'm one of those people who detect & identify aromas better than many others.)Too bad.  Even if I let them outgas for some time, I will always wonder what they are putting into things baked in them.

We have had great service and satisfaction from Lasko products for years and thought they were invincible. This heater really let us down. It looks nice and heats well but has shortcomings and safety problems we just could not live with.1. Although the direction of the airflow was variable, it sent the heat in the wrong directions and this could not be overcome. Straight forward to straight up was all it offers. Heated air needs to be directed in a downward path (heat rises, you know) to truly be efficient. My wife likes to put the heat near her feet to be comfortable and this was impossible. Nothing below the maximum downward flow (straight ahead) of this heater became appreciably warm.2. This heater has an extremely small depth footprint. Although relatively unstable and easy to tip over accidentally on hard floors, it tips itself over forward (with NO effort on our part) on carpeting due to most of the weight of the internals being slung forward. To use it at all in the family room, we had to put a relatively wide board under it.3. After a very little while on high heat, the power cord gets almost too hot to handle. Compared to other heaters we have (All Laskos), the cord on this model is very lightweight. We also noted that on other Laskos in this power range, they had 3 prong plugs and this one only has 2 prongs. VERY CHEAP and we never felt safe with it.Thanks to Amazon's great return policy, we were able to send this back for a full refund.

A2O03XUALG6PGD,B00005QFKG,G. Harkness,"[167, 191]","We did a lot of research on medium priced consumer blenders before first choosing the Oster Beehive Classic, and later when that broke, another from the same series that was marketed as a PROFESSIONAL version.Oster claims that these machines feature an ""All Metal Drive"" which implied to us that the parts that take all the torque and stress from grinding would be made of metal and not the usual hard rubber or plastic found in other brands. (This claim is totally FALSE as we later discovered first hand!)One of the repeated negatives reported by others about this and ALL Oster Beehive Style blenders was a problem with the drive axle shearing off between the motor base and the four sided metal spindle that mates to the bottom of the blade assembly on the jar.  This problem is actually documented by one unhappy owner with photos on the Oster BPST02-B page here on Amazon.  Turns out the Oster BPST02-B is the exact same design as this one even though it is marketed as a PROFESSIONAL version.Oster BPST02-B Professional Series Blender, BlackThe component that sheared off on both of the Oster blenders we tried was not METAL as Oster claims, but a hard rubber material that is obviously not strong enough to handle the stress of moving the blades through frozen fruit or ice cubes on a daily basis.See for yourself!Rubber drive coupling for Oster blenders & Kitchen Centers.Both blenders failed while making what I would consider a very simple and relatively non-demanding smoothie recipe.  The ingredients consisted of one frozen bananna cut into 2 inch chunks, 1 cup of milk with protein powder and a handful of ice cubes.  The milk and powder were first blended.  The machine was stopped and the chunks of frozen bananna were added.  We used the PULSE feature to grind up the bananna into a puree before finally adding the ice cubes.  We again used the PULSE feature followed by the full speed setting to blend the smoothie to completion.  This worked GREAT for the first several days with the end results being a PERFECT SMOOTHIE!  Absolutely no complaints on the blenders results WHEN THEY WORKED!On my SIXTH use of this model blender, when I added the frozen bananna chunks and hit PULSE, I heard a CLANG and noticed that the blades were not turning!  I removed the jar from the motor base to discover that the drive axle had completely sheared off the motor base and was lying there next to the other half that connects to the motor!OMG I said to my self!!  This is the EXACT PROBLEM that I had read about in other reviews dating back as far as 4 years ago!!  I had given this thing the benefit of the doubt and figured those reports must have been isolated incidents or pilot error.  With SO MANY 5 star reviews, how could this thing be a dud?EASY!When you consider that most people on this site review a product the day they take it out of the box, there is no way to know how long the thing worked for them before it broke!  And unfortunately, most people never bother to follow up their worthless 5 star review with an update on what they REALLY THINK 3 months down the road!  ;o)The Beehive is a great blender before it breaks, so yeah!  It is impressive on DAY ONE!  ;o)We returned the busted classic blender to Amazon for a refund and resumed our search for a blender that would last. After trying several other brands and not being satisfied with their blending performance or build quality, we decided to give Oster one more chance because their blender did impress us the most when it worked.  I was very dubious about this since I was pretty sure this design flaw would doom the BPST02-B too.Oster BPST02-B Professional Series Blender, BlackBOY WAS I RIGHT ABOUT THAT!  Less than 1 week after we began using it, the PROFESSIONAL VERSION ALSO BROKE with the SAME DRIVE FAILURE!At this point, after trying TWO different models from the same series there is no doubt in my mind that this product suffers from a serious design flaw that will eventually bring down EVERY SINGLE UNIT PRODUCED!Amazing how a product this unreliable has not been recalled!

A25ZRQBJFOIQNA,B0059KY05M,tellitlikeitis,"[2, 2]","I had a trusty Black and Decker Countertop Oven for 15 years. When it died, I cried, literally. A countertop oven is a staple in our house and is used daily for anything and everything. Bagels, casseroles, chicken, toast, french fries, pizza, we cook EVERYTHING in a countertop oven in our house. So, losing our Black and Decker Countertop Oven was a huge deal. We replaced it with a Hamilton Beach model that we got on sale, which lasted five years before it hit the countertop oven graveyard so I did not hesitate to purchase the Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven 3110 when I saw it on Amazon, now I'm wishing I never would have purchased it.In the beginning, this was a great countertop oven. It took 15 minutes to preheat to 475F and cooked evenly and consistently for the first week we owned it. We used it to cook waffles, bagels, toast, and frozen pizza primarily for the first week. All of the foods cooked perfectly, and we loved how quick and easy it was to set it, and forget it until the timer went off. The timer however was never accurate, and we had to set a kitchen timer to keep from burning food. Then, the second week of use came around and we started using it for Bagel Bites, Pizza Rolls, french fries, onion rings, and other similar foods. It would take almost 20 minutes to preheat the oven and wouldn't reach a temperature past 450F. I thought &#34;it's a fluke&#34; and we kept using it. By week four, it was taking nearly 30 minutes to preheat and wouldn't top 425F in temperature. We thought perhaps our oven thermometer was no longer accurate, we bought a new one, and got the same results. We tried cooking a frozen pizza, the same brand we had prepared before with this oven, and it came out almost raw in the center after 25 minutes of cooking.I e-mailed Hamilton Beach and they were less then helpful. They said that on Rotisserie mode the temperature varies and can increase and decrease throughout cooking. I told them that we were just using it on regular mode, not rotisserie mode, and they did not seem to understand why we were not using it on rotisserie mode. The fact of the matter is, it shouldn't matter what mode we were using it on, it used to work, and now it wasn't working. They issued us a replacement oven, had us cut the cord off the old oven, photograph it, and we received the new oven. Okay, we were fine with the replacement, and that should have been the end of it, but it wasn't.When the new oven arrived, it was like gold for the first three weeks. It heated to 475 in approximately 12 minutes. It never burnt toast, it cooked bacon crispy, pizza was cooked all the way through. It was a dream oven to work with, and even the timer was accurate this time around. We thought, maybe the first oven was a fluke, and we were happy once again to have a working countertop oven. Then, week 5 rolled around. The handle of the oven started getting very hot when we would cook things, not the oven itself (which is supposed to get hot), but the actual handle on the oven would get hot. Even with a potholder, you could sometimes feel the heat on the handle through the potholder and we wondered if something was wrong with the oven. That's when the temperature drops started, first it wouldn't reach above 450, then it wouldn't reach above 425, then it wouldn't reach above 400, and then it wouldn't reach 375. It wouldn't hold any temperature higher then 350F for more then 15 minutes without plunging drastically. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they issued another replacement, however this time, even though we were under warranty, we had to pay the shipping and handling which was $25 to get a new oven. I had purchased a warranty through Square Trade, and they refund shipping and handling charges, so I said sure send me a new one, gave them a credit card number, and we were off and running.The third Hamilton Beach Countertop 3110 Oven arrived and right out of the box, it would reach 475F during preheating, and then drop to 450F during cooking, and by the end of the 15 minutes of cook time, the oven temperature would be 350. Because of this we were having to double and even triple the amount of time it took to cook items in this oven. A pizza that took 15 minutes in the first oven we received in the beginning took 42 minutes before it was cooked enough to eat, and then it still had the soggy cardboard texture underneath because the oven heats so unevenly. I contacted Hamilton Beach again about the oven, and told them that this was now our third oven of the same model number and that they need to look into what's going on. They said that they could send another one, if you guessed it, we paid the $25 to get one shipped to us. We didn't pay, instead I choose to call Square Trade.I love Square Trade! I told them our plight and our experience, and within a half hour we had emailed them a photo of the oven with the cord cut off, and had an Amazon gift card to purchase a new oven. We went with an Oster brand model which has now been going strong for 7 1/2 months. It holds 475F without any problems, cooks evenly, and the handle never gets hot. It's unfortunate that we had such a bad experience with the Hamilton Beach Countertop  3110 Oven because we have other Hamilton Beach products in our home that we love, but obviously there is something wrong with this particular oven.

My one star rating is based on, and the reason I am returning it to the big box store I bought it from, is that it is incredibly difficult to use.The tank lifts out relatively easily, but note the blue portion on this machine.  It is the tank you fill--and when you remove it from the base, and turn over to add water, it is rounded on what is now the bottom.  This prevents you from sitting it on a counter/table or even the sink to unscrew the cap.  The cap alone is remarkably tight fitting (which is good--no leaks), but since you cannot sit the tank on a flat surface to gain leverage, you have to hold it against your chest with one arm/hand while struggling to get the cap off with the other.I cannot recommend this to anyone, much less someone who may not have much upper body strength, particularly an older person--it really is that hard to deal with.  This was not a feature I thought to consider when I purchased it (have had several Holmes machines throughout the years I have loved, but are now discontinued, that also had tight fitting caps, but were designed in such a way that you did have the ability to put it on the counter while opening).  This is a feature I will definately pay attention to in my next purchase.",1.0,Very difficult to open/fill,1359072000,"01 25, 2013"

I've been using it for smoothies, and it gets the job done right and quickly. However, it is very loud, much louder than the Ninja and other blenders I've used.It comes with more accessories than the Ninja, and I found them to be thoughtful, helpful accessories like extra tumblers, tumbler lips, travel lid, a jar with a shaker, etc. However, there is one rubber circular thing that I have no idea what its purpose is because I can't find it in the instruction booklet. I'd really like to know what I'm supposed to do with the darn thing.One thing I really don't like about the Bella is that it has the traditional design where the blender blends are at the bottom of the unit.

A2BQFWG01KX5LX,B002PY7AYS,David Mace,"[85, 112]","This review is a comparison between four Thermos mugs that I have, which I hope should explain why I don't give this one '5 stars'.Thermos 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel MugOverall, I like this 'E5' the best.  It's greatest shortcoming is that it does not fit in many car cup holders.  Unless you have a 'big gulp' sized cup holder, this will not be secure in the car.  Inside, it has a narrow mouth, which isn't too big a deal sticking tea bags or coffee bags into, or getting them out of (just invert & shake a bit).  The lid is pretty much one plastic piece with two seals, with no 'hidden' nooks and crannies to capture yucky stuff.  I've had these mugs for over a year and washed all of them in the dishwasher countless times, and they always seal well and work well.  I can shake boiling hot liquid in it upside down or put it in a backpack and not lose a drop.  Though if you have been drinking from it, the top usually has some leftover drops of drink in it to spill after you seal it.  Of all of these mugs, this seems to work the best keeping hot drinks hot.UPDATE: I figured out how to make this one fit in more car cup holders: The bottom comes off!  Afterward, you can snug-fit the bottom back on for desktop use, or pop it back off to wash or use in the car.  I've had a few of these for a few years, and they work perfectly.Thermos Nissan 14-Ounce Leak-Proof Insulated Travel MugThis one works about as well as any the others.  It fits in every cup holder.  The big handle is usually more in the way than useful.  It holds a little less drink.  The all-plastic lid with one seal comes apart into two pieces to clean, and can be annoying to snap back together.  It has the simplest design, and is the least expensive, and seals perfectly every time.  This one can be shaken upside down, and carried in a backpack.  It's hard to tell with this mug when you've filled it 'too much'.  I routinely end up trying to twist it closed with my fingertips immersed in hot drink.Thermos Stainless-Steel 22-Ounce Leak-Proof Hydration BottleThis is for cold drinks ONLY.  There is no way to sip a hot beverage, so if it's scalding hot, you will burn yourself.  That said, it keeps cold drinks really cold all day, and the pop-top lid is really nice, keeping the part that you touch with your lips clean of debris in environments where the other mugs collect dust and such and become cruddy.  It seals perfectly, and the secondary catch works flawlessly to keep it from accidentally opening without being a hassle.  This can be thrown into a backpack without any worries.  It is exactly the same form factor as the other 'E5' mug, but taller, so it won't fit into most cup holders, but the lid is so secure you can toss it anywhere and not worry about it.  Sadly, the tops are not interchangeable between this and the other 'E5' mug.  People talk about how ice stays frozen in this for days, but really, you never need ice.  If the drink you put in was cold, it will stay cold all day without ice.  Ice tends to just fuse together inside and take up space.Thermos Stainless King 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug, Midnight BlueThis one is only 'OK'.  It fits in every cup holder, and holds enough of whatever it is you're drinking and like every other thermos mug, keeps it hot/cold for hours.  On the down side, when the water's still very hot, agitating the mug will tend to cause it to shoot out of every seam, and if it gets in the threads of the lid, it will carry on dribbling long after you think it's 'under control'.  So, it's downright leaky, not 'leak proof'.  The seal works OK once the liquid has cooled down a bit, but after the first week of use it never passes the 'upside-down' test like the other cups without dribbling.  The lid comes in LOTS of little pieces that ALL collect residue, and I have to disassemble it and stuff all the parts in the silverware tray to keep them from touring the inside of the dishwasher.  (And YES, I do put it back together right.)  Unlike the other mugs, this has no plastic/rubber exterior parts, which is actually a minor annoyance, as it rattles audibly in my car cup holder, which also doesn't have any rubber parts.  There's a hook on the bottom of the lid, presumably for a tea bag string, but I always just remove the strings.Update: NOT OK!  Seal's basically ineffective after just a few months' use.  It's now an expensive dribble cup.  Three stars to one.  Rubbish compared to ANY other Thermos branded mug.One common feature of all of these is that any 'cream' drink, or powdered drink mix becomes a mess.  You can't leave any dairy products in the mug or the calcium will amalgamate with the stainless steel, permanently staining it.  So drink up and rinse it out promptly, or learn to enjoy your coffee as I do, black.  Anything much thicker than water will collect all over the nifty lids and form a layer of yuck.  It cleans off, but... yuck.My usual routine with these mugs is to remove the string from, then stuff a tea bag orFolgers Coffee Baginto the mug, and pour hot water in directly from the kettle.  I never remove the bag until after I've drunk it all, which usually takes a good, long time.  If you're supposed to be restricting your caffeine intake, this will help.  You'll literally drink one cup of sipping-hot coffee all day.",1.0,Several Different Thermos Mugs Compared,1271030400,"04 12, 2010"

You simply can't brew coffee in a few seconds, imo. Unfortunately, it is necessary however for those with tight schedules who don't have the time to wait for a pot of coffee to brew.  That would be me.  I have tried many, many varieties and find the quality to be fairly weak for the most part.  Some are better than others like the Newman's bold and the Green Mountain Nantucket, but they only really give 80% of the coffee experience for me.I bought this to try and get some of the true flavor from my bagged coffee favorites.  I tried experimenting with different grounds and levels.  No matter what I tried, I never had much more that brownish-flavored water.  The taste was much worse than a regular k-cup.  At least those had SOME flavor.  On top of the that, even waiting until the grounds cool does not prevent you having to dig your fingers into the screen to get the stuck grounds out while cleaning. I'm sure the screen will tear over time form my fingers, but I'm not sure how else to remove the grounds.  Plus, you still have to run it under water which gets grounds stuck in your garbage disposal.The waste with k-cups is bothersome to me so I thought I'd give this a try.

The reviews here are very high, so I expected to love this.After using it a few times to brown and crumble one pound rolls of ground turkey in a medium skillet, I found using the Chopstir not much faster  and unexpectedly annoying.It DOES chop through the meat easily with the upright design, but since it is 'X' shaped, you can't chop the meat at the edges of the pan as readily as in the middle.  Rotating or spinning the Chopstir to bring the meat around from the edge sounds like it'd be a snap, but pushes the meat away as much as it moves it around.  Also, you can't flip the meat over without a lot of spinning and hassle.  A regular spatula is so much faster for flipping over the un-browned meat that I end up using the Chopstir alternately with a standard turner, which adds back about as much time as the Chopstir saves, and adds another tool for cleanup.For a pound of meat in a typical skillet, its limitations outweigh the benefits.  It would probably be more useful and effective for 3-5+ pounds of meat in a deeper pot.I'm going out on a limb here since nearly everyone else seems to like this, but as a couple of the 3 star reviews said, it'll probably wind up in the back of the utensil drawer for me as well.",2.0,A suprising hassle for browning a pound of meat.,1369180800,"05 22, 2013"

Call me a sucker for specificity but that sounds like a better filter to me. In addition, rather than just soaking and then running a pitcher of water through the filter itself, the Filtrete owner is instead required to run cold water through it for 4 or so minutes--a major waste of water that could be used for plants or pets. And although the filters are supposedly recyclable (where?), they last only 1  months compared to Brita's 2 months. Let me get this straight: I need to replace filters that don't work as effectively as Brita's on a more frequent basis...yeah, right.The pitcher itself is very nice looking but seems very flimsy in quality (guess where it's manufactured?).

I own a Panasonic cordless iron for many years and I've been very happy with it but when I saw this dual use steamer / iron, I got it immediately.  Having a steamer was the main reason as I always wanted one but couldn't justify having another device in my small apartment just for steaming purposes.Well, I was very disappointed with what came out of the box.  First of all, the iron is extremely heavy.  With just the steamer, unattached, it's 1.5 lbs without water.  Connected with the iron bottom plate it weighs in at almost 3.75 lbs without water.  Once you add water it's way over 4 lbs.The other thing that was disappointing is that the steamer let's out only a tiny plume of steam, unlike the professional steamers.  That means you'll have to hold the steamer quite close, &lt; 12"" to have the steam reach your clothes.  Even my cordless iron lets out as much steam if I just hold it upright and turn the steam on max.  If you press the hotshot steam button on the handle, it will shoot out a quick jet of extra steam that's beyond the 12"", but it will spit water onto whatever it is you're trying to steam.  The steamer also makes a funny sound, BRRRR...phe phe phe phe phe..... A bit annoying.The iron works as expected but you only have the choice of lots of steam or no steam, nothing in between: not very effective.Finally, the quality of the components of this unit is not that great.

A2QRXWCOZJ0PK8,B003UBPB6E,Intheknow,"[1, 1]","Got this product a couple of months ago.  First time use was okay.  It picked up the dirt quite well (its best feature, but then that's what it's supposed to do, right?), but it seems that it wants to keep going in circles or over the same area time and again, and again, and again. Wants to ""make love"" to the legs of my furniture, especially the dining room table; once there, it will not progress but keeps going back and forth against one let of the table or a chair.  No kidding, it has a thing for that particular piece.  When the battery is low it will tell me it's returning to its base.  But it doesn't and seems confused as to where its base is located, even when I place it a mere two inches away from the base.  It still can't find it!  Hello? Oh yes, and here's a real positive (not), in the middle of the night when all is quiet and my husband and I are asleep, it will spontaneously start up; that's right, it seems to want to clean in the wee hours of the morning and leaves its base to do just that.  Trouble is, it's noisy and I don't want it going about the house running over cords, etc., when I'm asleep.  It seems angry and won't shut off when I finally get up and place it back at its base (should I say against its base, because it can never find it after leaving; perhaps it's developed Dementia or something). Perhaps it's somehow pre-programmed but I have gone over every possible menu and the instructions, etc., and it should NOT be turning on at four in the morning for a spin around the house. The only way to stop this seems to be to unplug the base unit (the charger).  Really, what's the point of all this?  If I have to plug in and unplug the charger, well...We've had this about three months now.  I am not as impressed as I was when I read all the positive reviews, or even when I tried it for the first time.  Some woman from the Neato Company called me about two weeks after I ordered through Amazon, asking me how I liked it.  At the time, I said I did because I hadn't actually used it more than once or twice.  If she called today, I'd tell her what I think now, and it wouldn't be very positive.  Again, it DOES pick-up dirt in between using my main vacuum, but with all the other negatives, I wouldn't buy another one.  Don't know if I will even bother replacing the battery in this one when the time comes. I think there are too many kinks yet to be worked out of this product. Years ago I had a Roomba.  It too was okay, but I'd say it probably worked a bit better than the Neato, that is until it died and went to Robot Heaven.  The company replaced a component and it was resurrected for a while, until it died once again.  At that point I tossed it out.  That's why I tried the Neato brand.  Neato is not that neato.

A15RNHWAK11A4R,B000UUBCNO,James Schroeder,"[1, 1]","After several days to using this product on three types of flooring (wood, short pile carpeting and lino/vinyl) I give it top marks for innovative technology.  Watching it spin and whirl about as it got it it's bearings was truly fascinating to observe. However, I cannot give it similar marks for it's ability to clean.Competition:15 year old Orek upright and handheld vacuum10 year old Sears Shop Vac2 month old AmorAll mini-shop vacStandard whisk broom, dust pan and brushI fully charged the battery in accordance with the instructions and set out to see just how well a $300+ vacuum compares to the old stand-by's.The long and short of this evaluation is the iRobot 560 Roomba did well in cleaning lightly dirty floors (sand, cat litter, dry cat food, etc.) on the hardwood and vinyl floors. It did however have major difficulty in cleaning along the baseboards and in the corners.On carpeted floors it did clean the top most layer of dirt (those nasty facial tissue shards left behind when not removed from pockets prior to washing and drying clothes, dryer lint, Christmas glitter, etc.) but anything below the top was left behind. What was most unusual was the battery life on carpeting. It was less than half that compared to the two other floors. I can only assume it was due to the increased rolling resistance encountered on carpet. The battery lasted for approximately 30 minutes on the hardwood-vinyl flooring but barely 13 minutes on the carpeting.I thoroughly cleaned the collection bin, filter and rotating brush and recharged the battery. Using the same type of typical dirt encountered in a home environment I repeated the cleaning test. The results were the same.To be completely fair, I again cleaned the Roomba and recharged the battery and repeated the test a third time. Results were the same.While the Roomba is a technology marvel in being able to navigate its way around a room and sweep up light soil it does have some serious drawbacks:It cannot adequately clean along the baseboards and corners (although I will credit it for trying)It did a fairly good job of collecting typical tracked in dirt on the hardwood-vinyl flooring it did have a particularly difficult time in sweeping up baking flour and body powder. I attribute this to the fine nature of the powder that actually seemed to blow past the rotating brush.Large dirt particles (glitter, dryer lint, cat litter, facial tissue shards) quickly clogged the filter and caused a rapid reduction in vacuum. I'm sure this was due to the rather small dirt collection bin and with careful watching/listening and cleaning the bin frequently would prevent this.Battery life was adequate on hardwood/vinyl flooring but with the increased rolling mass/resistance found with carpeting battery drain was quick; much too quick if you have carpeting throughout your house.Summation:I give the iRobot 4-Stars for technology. It's brilliant at snaking its way through and around obstacles and collecting light soil.But when it comes to actual real-life cleaning on a variety of floor types, especially battery life on carpeting and cleaning along baseboard and corners (where dirt just seems to gather in mobs) the best I can give the iRobot is 2-stars.My Orek upright and handheld does a much better job at cleaning on all floor types and when the baseboards and corners do stymie them the two shop-vacs make short shrift of the work. Even my trusty old sweep broom, dustpan and brush does a better job at cleaning out corners and gathering up the finer powdery types of dirt.For $300+ initial cost, plus filters and eventually a new battery I would save my money and purchase a good quality 'standard' vacuum cleaner and although, it does require you to slog it about room to room throughout the house in the long run it does a far superior job.",2.0,Technology gets top marks...but..,1306108800,"05 23, 2011"

Upon arrival everything looked great, item arrived in perfect shape thanks to good packaging that protects it in shipment. However it's with the actual usability and longevity where this saucepan falls short.I had only used the saucepan about 4-5 times over the course of about a month and around the 5th time of cleaning it with a nonstick safe soft 3M microfiber sponge, I noticed scratches on the surface of the non stick coating. This was especially perplexing to me since I had put such little use on it and had followed Calphalon's explicit care instructions.I actually contacted Calphalon regarding these scratches and provided them with photos. I expressed my dissatisfaction with their product and inquired about a possible warranty replacement.  They replied with this: ""Based on the photos the surface markings on your nonstick Calphalon cookware is normal and to be expected under normal use and care. However the markings should not break through to the cookware core."" They then provided information on how to return it for a warranty replacement, however based on their description of the marks, they are ""normal"". Since they don't break through to the core, it's doubtful that I would qualify for a warranty replacement and I'm not eager to spend the money to ship the saucepan back only to be told that it's not eligible for replacement.What's curious about these ""surface markings"" is that I see none of them whatsoever on a Calphalon Contemporary saucepan that I purchased around the same time. Even though I've put the same amount of use on this other saucepan, and cleaned it using the exact same sponge, it displays no markings/scratches on it's nonstick surface and still looks brand new. I can only deduce that because it's a higher end offering from Calphalon, and thus it has a more robust and tougher nonstick coating.In summary, if you are looking for a Calphalon saucepan I suggest you go with something from their Contemporary line instead of the ""Simply Calphalon"" line.

The DC24 is my first high-end, expensive vacuum cleaner, I was using a $75 Shark Vacuum (which isn't even their fanciest Shark vacuum) for a few years before deciding to upgrade. Boy, I wish I had just stuck to my old vacuum, it cleaned my carpet way better than the DC24 does. I have a 1 bedroom, 700 sq feet apartment, and about three quarters of the living surface is carpet. This does not pick up half of the things that the Shark picked up. I sometimes have kids around, and they drop things like Cheerio crumbs or bits of Jelly beans on the carpet. It takes a few tries to actually get the crumbs cleaned, I had to go over the spot multiple times before I was satisfied that everything got picked up. And let's not even talk about a whole Jelly bean, this machine will just push it around like that piece of candy is a darn puck and the vacuum is a hockey stick. If you enjoy recreational activities with your vacuum that might be okay, but it doesn't really float my boat.Last month I adopted a cat, and then all hell breaks loose. My little kitty likes to play with his bird toys, so there's bits of feathers that are also now on the carpet, and he's shedding a bit so now I see bits of his fur around the apartment too. And I get that animal hair is hard for vacuums in general to pick up, but really, for a $400 piece of equipment, I expected the DC24 to be able to handle most of that. I built a cat condo and pieces of the condo-carpet fell on my regular carpet, and the Dyson wouldn't even pick that up!Are there any pros to the vacuum? Sure. It's lightweight, and it does glide well across the carpet, and the ball technology does make it easier to go around furniture and scared little kitties. But those pros are not worth $400 dollars. I say save yourself some money and look to another vacuum. I've nothing against other Dyson models, so maybe another would work better, but this model is just not good.

But it falls short in so many areas ... the lid portion is so flimsy it actually twists uncontrollably when you lift it.  There is no way to make both parts lay completely flat for open-top grilling.  On my unit it is impossible to articulate the upper portion so it comes down flat on the food (as it's supposed to).  And, although the overall product is large enough to be able to handle two full-size sandwiches or 4 pancakes, it can't because the grills are not square/rectangular but rather one end is very curved.The lack of an instruction manual didn't bother me as much as it bothered some people ... it only has two controls - one of which is supposed to control temperature but the thing only cooks on the highest setting; and a mystifying control that seems to have something to do with using the unit as a grill press or open griddle, but in fact the heating elements do the same thing in both positions.As far as some concerns about the heating plates being ""lightweight"", that's not really the case; they seem to be made the same way as the ones on the Cuisinart.",2.0,Cheap knockoff,1364169600,"03 25, 2013"

ACUOXOSWMTL21,B00092ZVXA,protoguy,"[11, 17]","Congratulations, you have found an espresso machine that eats money. Because to figure out how to get this machine to make a decent espresso, it will never make a good one, you have to burn through a lot of cash. Let me give you the reality of this machine. I only rated this machine a 2 because people never take 1 ratings seriously. This machine is a 1, believe me. I have done a ton of research on this machine and found quite a few people who agree. Some people like it, but those people don't like espresso.I bought this recertified/refurbished at a really good price. I paid less than half what it retails for, even less than on here. It looks great, looks well made, and it's impressive to see in your kitchen. Everything is well placed, the drip tray is large and easy to remove and the steamer want is very articulated. Unfortunately that's where the features stop.Filters: The filters included with the machine are pressurized. Real espresso machines do not use pressurized filters. The filter is supposed to be forgiving, according to breville, since it's not easy to make a perfect espresso. Of course, this means you don't get a perfect espresso ever. It creates a fake crema and fake output. It pulls the shot way too fast and it comes out much weaker than it should. There is no way to fix this, that's just how the machine works. Breville will make excuses saying it's probably your fault, but after you've tried all I have, there is no excuse.Brewing: So this machine brews by pre-soaking the grind. Yes that's a great idea since it gets more flavor out of it. However in this machine, when you do that you expose the grind to hot water, then it starts to cool, then you expose it to hot water again and extract. This extracts a very sour part of the coffee and makes your shot taste a little off. The extraction uses too much pressure and no matter your grind you will get the same 10.5 second pull. Too fast, too thin, too weak. You can fix this problem by getting a non-pressurized basket, but then you have whole new problems.Brewing non-pressurized: So using one of these baskets will get you a strong shot. Unfortunately the same problems still apply. The shot will be sour and also too bitter. The reason for this is simple. The temperature will never be consistent. This machine uses a thermal block heater which heats up the water just before it goes into your grounds. This is fine for steaming but for espresso, it makes for an inconsistent temperature and bad flavor extraction. So you can fix that, sort of, you can amp up the temperature by using the steamer and priming the machine before you pull. Then you only put the cup under your drip just as the drip turns creamy dark brown. Then you stop the machine just after it turns light and has a bit of a crema built up. It won't be a great shot but it will probably taste better.This machine takes a lot of work to get a decent shot. A lot more work than you should have to put into a machine like this that boasts itself as an easy brewer. If you're used to putting having your shots added to a ton of milk, sugar, and flavoring then you won't care. However, if you actually like the taste of espresso, you won't like this machine. Let me put it this way. If you go to starbucks and order your caramel mocha latte with whip and 5 sugars, you will find this machine perfectly capable of making your drinks. If you like a ristretto or real cappuccino, then you won't.To show you how realistic this review is, here is how much pain I went through. I tried 3 different beans. I tried my own grinder. I tried a professional grind in 5 different grind settings. I weighed the amount of grinds going in the filter. I weighed my tamping pressure. I did 30lbs, 40lbs, 50lbs and even just barely pressing it down. I purchased a non-pressurized filter and a good tamper. I probably tried to get a shot out of this thing 100 times, I know it was at least 50. I have only produced one shot that was drinkable, but it still was not as good as a shot from starbucks. Which is disturbing. I know people say ""well you need the right grind"". I say to that, I tried 5 different grinds. 5. All espresso grind or finer down to turkish. So if you go look on coffeegeek.com you'll see that there are bad reviews and good reviews.The majority of reviews say this is a good machine. The majority of American espresso drinkers also enjoy their espresso with 2 cups of milk 2.5 sugars and 5 pumps of flavor with whip on top and flakes of magic flavor that makes espresso flavor just disappear. It leads me to wonder how many people actually know what espresso tastes like.",2.0,"Fake espresso, real money",1224720000,"10 23, 2008"

Unfortunately, even at the highest setting this toaster does not toast bread nearly as dark as I like it, so every slice will have to be toasted twice and watched so it doesn't overtoast on the second round.  Worse, anything smaller than a traditional slice of toast -- an English muffin or a slice of sourdough bread -- does not pop up high enough, so you have to reach down into the toaster to retrieve it, burning a finger or two along the way.

The press is easy enough to load, and you turn the knob at the top so that the teeth catch on the handle side, allowing the handle to push it down incrementally.  Simple enough.  However, one pump was not usually enough to get the dough out, and two was too much dough.

The lid was starting to have trouble opening all the way. I repair for a living so I took it apart to see what I could find. The output shaft of the gearbox which connects to a loading spring had a lot of radial play. I thought that it was a worn housing, but it turns out the support housing at the plastic bushing for the shaft broke. There was only 1/8"" of shaft supporting the opposite end of the gear shaft which I believe was way to little. There is a spring that preloads the output shaft and it is connected to the outboards side of the output shaft and it aids the motor in opening the lid, and slows it down when closing.Taking it apart was not fun . . . they use pins and links to connect the lid to the gearbox. To remove the pins you need to undo the crimped area on the end by squeezing the flared area even with the pin. Once you remove the gearbox from the lid you can work on the gearbox.TAKE THE BATTERIES OUT FIRST BEFORE TAKING UNIT APART SO IT DOESN'T ACTUATE DURING REPAIRS!!!I removed the pin from the lid, then the lid from the gearbox link. Take 8 screws out from the bottom of the lid, be careful not to pull off the battery wires to the power switch and power plug. Remove screw holding the preload spring and take spring off with spring clip. remove all screws holding gearbox. You may need to move the switch assembly out of the way to get gearbox out. Take 3 screws out of the gearbox and you can open it up to access the damages. Mine had broken output shaft support bushings.I used a vice and a small 1/4"" sockets to press the gear on the shaft so there is 1/4"" shaft on inboard side of gear. There was only 1/8"" which I believe cause the support to break, I now have 1/4"" of shaft going into the inboard bearing. I had to repair the support by crazy gluing the bushing support back into the housing half. I also had to repair the outboard bearing support with crazy glue. Both pieces glued very well since it was hard plastic. I reassembled the unit and it works like new smooth and quiet, it used to slam shut before it stopped working.Should have never broke, plastic bushings were stressed because there was not enough shaft going into it and all the load was at the edge which caused it to crack after being hammered repeatedly during normal usage. You can buy new lids for $39 from iTouchless but with the shipping from California it will cost too much. I bought a whole new other unit to try since I don't know how long this one will work.

The cake is completely cooked through, so being underdone is not the problem. I imagine it would come out better with a light spread of grease in the cups before baking, but I thought one of the purposes of silicone was to make it unnecessary for such a thing. I tried baking in the pan twice (with an extra rinse of clean water) to see if my problems persisted, and the results remained the same.

I was not at all impressed by this machine's design - no power button, tiny water inlet, short electrical cord and small water capacity. The microfiber pad tends to get wet in the front and will fold over if you push the Monster too fast, causing the unit to tip over. Pushing it slow enough so that it wouldn't do that on my slate floors resulted in my only being able to mop 1.5 rooms before the steam ran out. Wait 10 minutes while it cools down... re-fill the 2-cup capacity through a tiny fill hole that only a cricket could appreciate, wait 7 minutes to heat up and proceed... mop another 1.5 rooms and repeat!I DON'T THINK SO. I want a steamer that will not require me to take a break after mopping every room. I don't know about you people, but I want my appliance to work WITH me, not against me. I don't want it to take all day to mop my floors if it doesn't have to. I also felt that the unit was designed to be cheap and skimp on features at every turn. No power button? Awkward and short power cord? Microfiber cloths that get wet and flop over? Small 2-cup capacity? I could go on and on.I return this monstrosity and got a Ladybug Tekno instead. I know the Ladybug is in a different league and not a direct competitor to the Monster - the Ladybug costs $1,899 after all.

I sometimes wouldn't hear the noise long past the point of boiling and other times would instinctively make a grab to stop the fragile top from bouncing. If you take off the glass top you have no way to pour it without the steam burning the crap out of your hand. So it made sense to hold the top down with a towel while I poured, which also prevented the top from falling out when I tried to pour out the last bit of water. Between the handle and the lid this kettle always felt precarious. Safely pouring tea from it was a careful process. Not all too difficult, but it often required more patience and mindfulness than I had if I was in a rush, packing tea to take with me for the day.The glass was particularly thin and one day, after a little bump while cooking, it burst.

These measuring spoons are generally easy to use, although the depth of the spoon bowl and the shape make it a bit difficult to get some viscous liquids out without the use of a narrow silicone spatula. My steel measuring spoons work better for this purpose.I also find that spices like cinnamon and finely ground ginger tend to cling to the plastic much more than other measuring spoons. There is a lot of thickness to the spoons, probably for sturdiness, but sometimes they don't fit well into spice containers.

After being boxed with its fellows my first strawberry (in fact all of mine) had its leaves lying perfectly flat against its lovely shoulders.  This means the huller (me) has two choices: plunge the jaws into the leaves and twist to cut or gather those leaves and try to convince them to stand up or pull them off with my fingers before taking the plunge.  I tried both methods.  In the flat leaf method the claw easily cuts through the leaves both on the way in and during the twist.  This leaves lots of leaf fragments that must be cleaned off the strawberry.  If your strawberry has been recently washed and is damp, the leaves like to cling.  (In the video the second strawberry did produce a leave fragment which was easily whisked off by a finger.  The strawberry and leaf must have been dry.  Guess I could wash my strawberries early in the day and let them sit around the kitchen for however long it takes to evaporate the residual H2O.)  In the first-pull-off- the-leaves-method, the claw worked fine.  I timed both methods.  Whether you get rid of the leaves before or after &#34;clawing,&#34; the operation from virgin strawberry to clean hulled strawberry took an average of 5 seconds.  To use a small paring knife (my usual method) took an average of 2 seconds to slip the blade under the damp leaves, cut a small v-shaped valley in the berry and clear the blade with a whisk of my thumb leaving it ready for the next surgery.  My conclusion is that if you have lots of time and want strawberries ready to fill with fancy chocolate, maybe this thing is worth the money.  Don't plan to do this for a banquet, however, because the claw takes a fare amount of thumb strength the push it out and open.  I can predict that your thumb will be seriously strained!  It's better to take my same small paring knife and, placing it across the shoulders of the berry and the little valley you already cut at a 90-degree angle, make a second cut straight down to the tip of the berry (1 second).

I wanted to love it, but the thing would jam with celery (cut into 1 in pieces) and greens (also cut), and even carrots. I watched the videos on You Tube diligently about how to baby the Omega VRT.

The lid represented in the photo is an excellent lid, and I wanted to purchase more of the lid pictured, but was unable to obtain the lid pictured. The lid actually offered contains a sliding component that can be moved back and forth to open the cover to allow you to drink from the Tervis tumbler, then allows the user to slide the part back to close the lid. The sliding part, when closed, does not keep the beverage contents from spilling if the tumbler is tilted, and fails to keep the beverage temperature stable. Rather, it exposes the tumbler contents to the temperature of the environment, in addition to allowing the beverage to spill out of the tumbler because of the lack of a good seal. Further, and more inconvenient, the lid allows the beverage to pool in the lid after you slide the tab open so as to allow the beverage to flow into your mouth as you drink from the tumbler through the lid. The pooled beverage then dribbles down your chin and onto your clothing and anything else you might have nea, such as furniture you are seated on, books you are carrying, you purse or briefcase, your vehicle's upholstery, etc.In conclusion , this is a very poorly designed and cheaply made lid that can cause expensive consequences of clean-up rather than convenience that it would appear to offer.Search for and buy the lid pictured, with the simple, single straw hole.

A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B005KQ8NTO,B. Colonna,"[12, 14]","UPDATED 1/16/2014:We still use this scale for a quick weight check, but once the initial battery died after just a few months, we assumed it was just an old battery that had been sitting in the scale from the factory.  Usually you get good life out of a Li-Ion coin style battery in something like a scale.  However, this thing just chews through batteries. It makes no sense to me.  We use the scale like anyone else, family members get on it for a few seconds every few days or so.  Yet, no matter what brand battery I buy, they go dead after just a couple of months or so, sometimes less.  I don't have that experience in any other device where these batteries are used.  As of today it is dead.  The batteries I've tried are new and work in other devices, but the scale is dead.  While it is inexpensive, I'd avoid it.  It was never very accurate so it was OK for a quick general weight, but it failed prematurely now as well.INITIAL REVIEW:The Omron SC100 Digital Scale is very sleek and exceptionally thin.  It's glass surface is an opaque white.  The glass does not touch the floor.  It is raised by four rubber/plastic pedestals.  It is very low profile, raised about 5/8"" off the floor.The SC100 is simple to use.  Take it out of the box, remove the plastic tab which activates the battery, and place it on the floor.  When you step on, the scale activates and displays your weight.The display is large and easy to read even if you normally wear reading glasses, etc.  The display area is about 2 7/8"" wide by 1 "" high. The display is black on gray LCD.  It is not backlit so you need to use it in a room with normal lighting.  The display is four position (hundreds, tens, ones, and tenths).The scale is advertised as capable of up to 400 pounds.  I have been on it while holding my Golden Retriever, which amounts to 295 pounds.  So the glass surface appears strong.My lone criticism of the scale, and it's a big one, is accuracy.  The main purpose of a scale is to weight things accurately.  The SC100 is very sensitive to the floor surface on which it sits.  I have tried it on several floors, both hardwood and tiled.  The scale varies too much in the weight it displays.  Even using it on a new hardwood floor in a newly built, level room, the scale varies.  I'm not talking about  or  a pound.  The SC100 will vary by about 3 pounds, sometimes more, when put in different spots on the same smooth, level surface.That, to me, is unacceptable.  So this scale is inexpensive, and it'll give you an approximate weight.  But if you need a scale which is accurate, for weight loss, weight gain, or sports weighing, look elsewhere.  3 or 4 pounds is too much variance.So if you can live with the variance, this is a very nice looking, inexpensively priced scale.  If you need more accuracy, look elsewhere.",2.0,Sleek Look . . . . Accuracy Issues,1317513600,"10 2, 2011"

Because I'm a bit of a wine geek, I had my wife help me with a blind tasting of three different wines, one each night for three nights. I used identical Riedel glasses for this purpose to match the wines I was tasting. I tasted a Napa Cabernet, a Napa Petite Sirah, and a Sonoma Zinfandel. Without going into details on each wine, I will simply summarize and say that I preferred the wine that was poured through the Vinturi each time. While the nose was similar on all three, the flavors and smoothness of the wine were much better with the Vinturi. In fact, I found no noticable difference between the OXO product and pouring directly into the glass. If you really want to aerate your wine, use a Vinturi.The only benefits to this is that it's a clean, cool looking pourer. It does not drip and is removed easily from the bottle.

That's good because they tend to do an excellent job cleaning carpets.  But not all cyclonic vacuums are the same, even though they tend to look the same.  I'm going to compare this Dirt Devil cyclonic vacuum to the cyclonicEureka AirSpeed ONE Pet, Bagless Upright Vacuum AS2030Ato demonstrate what may or may not work for someone looking at these types of vacuums under $100.At the time I'm writing this, the Eureka is under $80 and this Dirt Devil is under $100.  The Dirt Devil is obviously made better, and is much heavier than the Eureka.  That's both good and bad.  It's good because it appears to be of a higher quality construction.  It's bad because it's much harder to push than the Eureka on carpets.  The Eureka is self-propelled and sort of pulls the person vacuuming along with it. This Dirt Devil is so hard to push that I believe it would have made a major callus on the inside of my right thumb, if I had continued vacuuming with it.  It also is too heavy to prop up on stairs to vacuum, unlike the Eureka.  Moreover, the Dirt Devil does not even come with a proper type of stair attachment.  Usually, that is not a problem, since all vacuum attachments seem to fit on other brands of vacuums.  That's not the case with this Dirt Devil, though.  Attachments from other vacuums don't fit.  The little brush attachment that comes with the Dirt Devil looks like it was made to clean electronic items, not household stuff.This Dirt Devil swivels, too, like a Dyson, whereas the Eureka does not.  If you like the swivel nature of the Dysons, then this Dirt Devil is a cheaper alternative.  Unfortunately, swiveling vacuums leave me with a sore shoulder, even though I don't have shoulder problems.  Hence, adding up the swiveling motion, the heavy weight, and the lack of proper cleaning attachments left me not liking this Dirt Devil very much.  It does clean floors and carpets okay, however, although it does not do carpets as well as the Eureka.  Thus, I see this Dirt Devil as being more of a dorm or apartment vacuum for strong young people who need to vacuum electronics, as well as limited floors and carpets.Update 10/31:  I still think this is a lousy vacuum cleaner, but the little combination brush/crevice attachment that comes with it is indeed great for vacuuming electronic items.  I had to vacuum a scanner my cat slept on all summer, and the Dirt Devil attachment did the job!  I needed both the brush and the crevice tool, and since they are attached, it's just a matter of sliding the brush up or down, as opposed to having to take one attachment off the hose and putting another one on.",2.0,More Suitable For Young People In Dorms Or Apartments . . . .,1378252800,"09 4, 2013"

A1HFT68GJ42LTM,B00HVJCB3C,AverageGuyShopper,"[1, 2]","This is my third different brand of Anti-fatigue mat I own.  All three mats are on my hardwood oak floor in the kitchen.  The other two are the Imprint brand (bought a few) and Gelpro (another VINE item).  The short and simple is the Serta is not as good, and I'll detail why below:Thickness:  The &#34;thinnest&#34; of the three is definitely the Imprint brand, and I can feel the floor the most of the three.  While that may seem bad initially, the mat actually conforms to the shape of your feet more and the mat feels more like a gel support and less bouncy than the other two.  The Serta and the Gelpro are of the same thickness.Feel:  The Imprint does feel the most gel-like, best foot conforming of the bunch.  But I definitely can feel my heels to the floor more, and if you plan on standing in the same spot for a very long time, this may not be adequate for you.  The Serta and Gelpro pass the heel test better (equivalent).Design:  If you like paisley, then you'll like the Serta.  But I fear this patterned surface might make sticky stains harder to scrub out.  The Imprint has a bunch of hatch marks, but it is still pristine after years of use.  The Gelpro has no pattern at all.Border:  The Imprint mat has no tapered border, and makes more of the surface area available for your feet to use (~95%).  I have never tripped on it.  The other two have a tapered border which reduces the likelihood of trippage for the thicker mats.  However, the tapered edges reduces the level area available to your feet.  There is a 2 inch tapered border, which yields about 70% of level mat for your feet (416/600 sq in).  The Gelpo is also about a 30% reduction of level mat.  If you place the mat all the way up to the quarter-round border of your floor under the cabinet, you probably will not care about the taper for that one side.Slip resistance while used:  Of the the three, the Serta initially was the worst.  The other two didn't budge much at all when pushed hard with one foot forward.  Straight out of the box, the Serta moved.  Until I cleaned it, then the anti-slippage was much better and was on par with the other two.  Which leads me to the next point...Coating:  The other two mats are &#34;clean&#34; out of the box.  The Serta not only SMELLS strongly, but is coated in a weird kind of oil.  This initial oil coating makes the mat a little slippery and will leave a spot on the floor where you initially put it a little slicker (like you just lightly polished it).  I wiped the mat off on both sides with a wet paper towel and let it dry before I retested it again.  DEFINITELY wipe the residue off the mat for better performance.  Since I initially tested it barefoot, I had to go wash my feet with soap and water because I could feel it on the bottom of my feet and in my slipper... yuck.  The mats should be cleaned off more before shipping them them out.Price:  The Serta's are the cheapest of the three ($40 versus $40 - $50).  I know that the Imprint mats tend to go on Deal of the Day about twice a year on Amazon.Country of manufacture:  I don't know.  But the Gelpro is labeled as made in the USA.  The Imprint mat is also unknown.Boy, I didn't know I could write so much about an Anti-fatigue mat. Hope this helps!",2.0,Compared the Serta to Imprint and Gelpro brands.  Smells.

A3JGFQZR5BJFF8,B00608D66G,OC Doc,"[2, 2]","Bought this popper 14 months ago. Makes great popcorn. Body of popper easier to clean and less likely to warp than its aluminum predecessor. Steel body is dishwasher safe (though the lid is not safe in dishwasher).Two weeks ago the handle broke: the screws that bolt the wooden handle to the stirring mechanism/lid broke. Without the handle secured, the unit cannot be tilted after popping to empty the contents into a bowl.Called Great Northern. Warranty was for one year. I called one month after warranty lapsed, hence no support. Purchased a new complete lid for $15, which seemed reasonable. After two weeks, lid arrived. Unfortunately it was ONLY the lid, no handle and no stirring mechanism, in contrast to the ""complete lid assembly"" listed in the invoice. In addition, the lid shipped wasn't stainless steel, it was aluminum (i.e. a part that corresponds to the lower end aluminum popper). The lid to the steel popper has a rod that inserts into a hole in the side of the popper, whereas this lid did not have the rod (hence, it was intended for the aluminum model).Heard the next day from orders department: no worries, we will ship you a new stainless steel full lid assembly.Today: parts dept e-mails me to say the part is back-ordered and that they are refunding my $15 lid purchase. Evidently I am welcome to contact them after six weeks to see if the part is in stock by then.Bottom line: excellent product WHILE IT LASTS, but support and customer service merit only one star. I had owned a succession of the aluminum model poppers (four in 10-12 years) and the handle never broke before----leading me to believe that the lid that came with my steel model was defective. If parts dept doesn't restock the lid assembly, then the only alternative is to buy an entire new unit. My aluminum poppers would last 3-4 years, at which point they became difficult to clean, or the stirring mechanism eventually wore out, and for a $20 item the length of use was reasonable. This time I splurged on the higher priced model, thinking it would net me more quality and durability, and it turned out to be the shortest-lived popper of them all.",2.0,Great popper while is lasts...customer service and support are zero stars,1395100800,"03 18, 2014"

However, I have needed a replacement bowl cover and bowl for many months because the bowl cover is coming apart at the rim (something that happened fairly early on, I might add) and the bowl's safety mechanism is missing the appropriate stop making it a matter of having to hold the lid in place with one hand while pushing food through the chute with the other, otherwise the cover slips out of place and the processor shuts off. Worse still is when the bowl cover slips past the broken off stop, making the lid impossible to remove without inserting a small screw driver and manually pushing the safety lever in the handle of the bowl down while sliding the lid back into place. Since they are no longer actively manufacturing my version, which is less than seven years old, I have found it impossible to find a replacement for the bowl cover, which I know has been on back-order since at least May of 2007. Kitchenaid promised replacements by January of 2008, and now has revised the date to April 2008. You should be aware, if you purchase one of these products, that replacement parts may be exceedingly difficult to obtain as your processor gets older. This may be true of other brands as well, I don't know, but I have finally decided to give up waiting for my replacement parts to come and have purchased another food processor OF ANOTHER BRAND. I know one thing, I will NEVER buy another Kitchenaid product, based on how poorly they have handled this backorder issue. And I am not alone. There is a huge backorder for the bowl cover, so it is a design flaw they cannot overcome and will not admit to, in my estimation.

A2C8W1VCVWPY13,B007P6SAZ4,booksy,"[0, 0]","I should have known that this cooker would be too good to be true, but I was really curious about whether it would work. As a vegetarian who follows a very low-fat diet with no added oils, I was intrigued by the promise in the title of ""oil-less"" frying. Would it work? Sadly, no.The fryer has a large, sturdy glass bowl, however it took up a lot of space on my counter. The cord is really short, also, so it needs to be close to an outlet. I am 5'6"", but getting food out of the deep, hot bowl was very awkward, and the fryer comes with a metal extender ring to make it even taller, but cautions that the metal becomes very hot, so that would make it even harder to get food out of it. I can't imagine how a shorter person would handle this cooker if it was placed on a standard kitchen counter.I made french fries (twice) and onion rings in the fryer, using no oil. I made a mistake with the first round of fries and put them in the lower rack, so when they came out under-cooked and only slightly browned around the edges, I thought it was my fault. However, my second batch on the high rack turned out even worse. They were cooked through, but did not brown at all. The onion rings didn't fare any better. They were slightly crisp, but not browned. I suspect that the manufacturer knows this and has included a spray bottle that you can use to spray oil on the food if desired. I felt that this was a little fraudulent, since it says ""oil-less fryer"" right in the name.Another thing I didn't like was the timer. Most analog timers allow one to dial the timer to a higher number, then pull it down to the correct time that you want. The instructions in the manual state that this should never be done and will damage the timer, so if you accidentally set it for too many minutes, you're supposed to wait until the correct time and then put your food in. That's inconvenient. Also, although the bowl is large and deep, the mesh basket that holds the fries/onion rings is really not that large, and only held one large potato and half of a large sweet onion. If I had a family of four it would take me up to an hour just to make fries! Supposedly you can use the bottom rack to cook chicken while you've got fries going in the top rack, but I could definitely see myself getting burnt while trying to fiddle with the cover of the oven, reaching over to get the food out, etc. It's just way too cumbersome.I would have given it one star, but to be fair, I didn't try chicken in it and it does come with a two-year warranty, but to be honest, if you want to make oil-less fries and onion rings, you can make a lot more and get just as good results using your regular oven.",2.0,Not Worth It,1341360000,"07 4, 2012"

I have not used the machine a lot and it has been on my kitchen counter since it arrived. I took photos to show you and posted them in the photo gallery. They are both on the bottom sides and appear to be in the same spot. Odd thing is, they appear to be `pressure cracks'. It appears something cracked it internally. I even tried to see if pulling on any of the outer parts would make the cracks move and I could not grab any part where the cracks would split. I guess somewhere during the use of the unit something inside the mechanical part cracked it. Again, the piece felt `cheap' as I wrote in the review and with cracked plastic on both sides, it really feels cheap. I am now taking my review from a 4 to 2 star. This unit was not even used four solid months. It does not seem to affect the use of the machine but I am fearful of being burned and something else happening since the pressure cracks are widening. I boxed it up and moved it off the counter. It was great while it lasted but making a `cheap' maker and bad quality does not impress me.I was very familiar with the name Capresso. In April of 2008 I boughtCapresso MT600 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Stainless-Steel Thermal Carafe. Back then I wanted a coffee maker that not only tasted good but looked good in my smaller kitchen as well. Also, the maker was easy to store. With my previous model I could stash it away and take it out when company came over for coffee. That is when I learned of this brand and became familiar with them. One of my guest years ago loved the look of it she bought one to have when her guest came over for coffee and she stored it on top of her fridge. Capresso to me is known for looking good so even sitting on top of my friend's fridge, it looked great.I have been using this unit for several months now. I will admit that I drink a lot of coffee but do not know much about temperatures, pumps, all the thinks pros would know. I am more concerned about if the maker leaks and how does the coffee taste. I currently own a Tassimo by Bosch TAS2001UC Single Serve Coffee Brewer, White, which I use year round. I love my Tassimo and over bought on the cups on them so I use it a lot.Comparing it to my Tassimo, it has about the same footprint which surprised me because the Capresso seems a lot larger. Also, the water tank location is in the same area and you fill it the same way. But the Capresso is not a Tassimo, I use it when I want espresso or coffee. Perhaps I am even making it wrong but I use finer ground coffee and less water for the espresso and thicker grounds and more water for coffee. Be aware though that your cups needs clearance so make sure they are small.With that I really like that once I make a cup it is not piping hot. I have read other reviewers complain about that, I like that I can sip from it straight from the machine after brewing. I think the biggest compliment I could give this machine is it does not taste burnt. I guess that is why the temperature does not get too hot. A lot of makers even on the same settings will taste burnt or even smelled burnt while making them, not this machine.It is important to read the instructions when using this. Another feature I love is the cup sizes. It comes with one cup and a two cup. I usually just use the two cup since I drink more than the average person. If you do not read the instructions, you can sit there and try to line up the filter to the insert and actually scrap the metal. I had a friend try to use it and I had a few metal pieces in the insert I had to clean out. It is important that with the cups, there is a bump that you need to line up to the insert and turn. Without this, you will not be able to use it probably. Also make sure the handle is in the locked position. A few times I thought it was and had coffee everywhere. The locking is not easy but not hard either. I guess what would have been nice if it clicked or something when locked. I thought a few times it was locked and the coffee leaked out of the insert. It was more user error but you need to pay close attention to it.Another added benefit, the one cup is designed to use with coffee pods. I do not have any but I know a lot of people use them with other machines. That is a bonus if you use pods for another device in your kitchen.I am deducting a star for quality. Capresso makes great products; they look great to the eye. My other maker was made a lot better than this one. However, this one has a few pieces, steam handle, trays, that just feel `cheap'.

Also, all of the wiring did not fit into the channels at the back of the assembly--one of the main reasons I purchased the unit.

Then in July or August--it was installed in December 2011--I was cleaning the TV and the two components at the top simply fell off--luckily I was nearby and was able to catch them.

I tried to reattach the rubber foot but it would not properly attach so I simply took the two components off and put them elsewhere.

AG1SWW2JJSP5F,B008FT3PM8,"Zot ""Zot""","[6, 11]","Before I ordered this, I knew one part was plastic: The ""filter"" attached to the lid. I didn't like the prospect of having a ""filter"" there, as it's utterly useless, and I really didn't like the prospect of having plastic coming into contact with my coffee. That said, this was $15, vs. $20 and up for most other models, and I thought perhaps the ""filter"" would be removable.Here's what I've noticed.1. The glass beaker seems normal, though less perfectly smooth than the small glass beaker on my La Cafetiere French press. I am not sure if that's normal for French presses this size (34 ounces/1 liter), as I've never had one so large, or if it's a sign of inferior glass forming.2. The handle is in fact a continuous metal strip throughout--the same as the legs and the strip running down the side--but is covered in rubber or something similar. So I'm glad to know that's not simply plastic attached to metal, as that would spell disaster--eventually a plastic handle will break off.3. The metal pieces holding the filter in place at the bottom of the beaker are very scuffed and appear to be low-quality metal. (The filter is sandwiched between two--a circle shape with a cross in the middle underneath, and a normal circular piece with holes to allow the liquid to come up.) If anything rusts, I would bet this will be the first culprit.4. Most disappointing, unless my eyes and hands are mistaken, the ENTIRE lid is made of plastic that is simply covered in chrome paint on the outside to make it look like metal. The ""filter"" piece also appears to be impossible to remove, though I'm not sure whether it's glued in or molded in.All in all, this is a French press on the cheap, and is not worth a penny more than I paid for it.

I'm considering moving back to that kettle -- it's elegant, simple, and predictable over four years of service.)UPDATE:My replacement unit is much closer with the presets: now instead of all of them mapping to 160degF, they each produce water about 5 degrees cooler than they claim, except for boil, which actually boils.

So waiting for the top to be mostly cooked is key in having the perfect pcake. Also I made my egg whites with it and I had to grease sides and wait for egg to cook to remove the ring. The ring gets hot but not too hot that you can get burned. I think this design is decent but they should have made with bamboo handle while keeping the metal parts.

It looks great.Alas, it is very limited on tea-making. It is on a fixed time cycle at a fixed temperature. For tea bags, that's OK. The tea will generally be small leaf, often the ""fannings"" that are like tea dust and blended to release their full taste quickly -- a minute or so. They survive microwaving, hottish water, and oversteeping. This kettle will give as good a brew as you can expect from the ingredients. The brew will be assertive and unsubtle but fresh and full.Loose leaf teas are entirely different. They demand a narrow range of temperatures. Black teas are best for this machine. They require water that is at boiling point and a brewing time of 2-3 minutes. The Krups kettle does a pretty reasonable job with these. I tried an estate Assam, which can be very bitter if brewed too long. The Krups takes 4-6 minutes for a few cup-sized brew. The tea was pleasant and more than good enough. I also tried a higher grade Yunnan Gold Tips that was OK but not as full in flavor as the tea is when brewed at 212 degrees for 2 minutes. Using a very fine Temi was a bit of a waste; the overtones of flavor were lost.I then tested a good quality Young Hyson green tea that is fairly full but delicate. The result was not satisfying. The blacks withstand the zap but it was too much for the hyson and for a Jasmine pearl I also tried. The tea was bitter and flat. With oolongs that are more like black teas -- water just below boiling with a slightly longer brewing time of 3-4 minutes -- the result was better. I tested a Big Red Robe and basic Formosa leaf that were both fully acceptable, with a clean taste.The lack of temperature and time controls is a definite limitation. It means that this is an enhanced kettle not a real brewing device. I plan to use it for black teas and everyday smoky oolongs but not for green teas. I really do like the styling, though the basket and lid are awkward to handle and ensure correct fitting into the pot. It has the merit of not pouring boiling water directly onto the tea leaf but infusing the leaf in a way that keeps it aerated. But it's a compromise. The temperature/time issue is absolutely critical in making tea and the main reason that so many tea bag brew ups are so truly and irredeemably dreadful. The Krups compromise provides a better cup but not the best. I hesitate to recommend it but equally hesitate not to do so. The trade off is between form and function. If you don't drink a lot of tea the form is perhaps of more relevance than the function and makes it well worth buying.",3.0,Elegant but doesn't make good tea,1366761600,"04 24, 2013"

This product steams lighting fast -- faster than any other steamer that I have used, and that's plenty. However, the steady stream of steam doesn't last long so you'll want to move fast to get your cleaning doneThe one thing that made this particular steam mop stand out from the others is the adapters to make this steam mop an &#34;all in one&#34; product. As a steam mop it does an okay job of getting the floors clean but don't expect to be able to remove the daily build up of hairspray on your bathroom floor from your teenage girls.

The jet stream adapter is supposedly for scouring shower tiles and other such things but in no way banishes stains unless you touch the metal directly to what you are trying to clean. Even then it's hard to get it really clean because you quickly run out of steam. Actually, good luck on trying to see what you are cleaning because this product really steams up like a sauna. The squeegee adapter for window/mirror cleaning would be ingenious if it actually cleaned windows/mirrors. Instead it just fogged them up and left streaks of water behind. The one thing I did like that worked well was the clothing adapter. This will evenly steam out clothes! The three &#34;scrubber brush&#34; adapters were also useful. They are stiff and scour worthy but beware on what you use it on... I left a few scratches behind. Not too terribly bad, mind you, but noticeable. The wire brush, obviously, should not be used on anything that can scratch but does a fabulous job on removing build-up with the steam action on grills.

A2JSKM60VTCNI,B005IR4W7W,"Paul Stuart ""&#34;...also I'll brush my teeth...","[24, 28]","Referencing constructive critics of this coffee maker - and as a needed disclaimer - I love my coffee, but don't expect barista grade drip from a $100 machine. Thus, my expectations were for a reliable, programmable, even temperature, consistent drip, and easy to clean coffee maker. The DCC-3000 meets and exceeded all these requirements.ISSUES RAISED IN PREVIOUS REVIEWS:I'm wondering if Cuisinart quietly upgraded this unit from its earliest reviews, notably the coffee gauge that I've had little to no problems with. I did find, however, that the reservoir seating is critical to the gauge level. Meaning, a non-perfect fit will declare it always full/empty. Try re-seating the main reservoir if the gauge is acting ornery. Still, it's best to consider the gauge a guide versus accurate assessment of cups left.On a related note, be very careful to ensure the water (FIRM placement) and coffee reservoirs, likewise the basket area are placed properly. The spilling others noted did cross my path, and appeared linked to the brew basket area slightly off. Note that the basket indicates placement within the reservoir via a textual marker (top right).Again - and per above - I didn't expect greatness, but did not find the coffee burnt in any way. The temperature remained steady and drinkable...better than a beloved, previous Cuisinart I owned.Finally, most of the DCC-3000 can be cleaned in a dishwasher. There's no need for baking soda or other methods. The manual specifies what elements can/'t be cleaned. As an educational point: the filter itself can also be washed in the dishwasher. A thorough cleaning of this is sorely needed every now and then (a quick whiff will give that away!).ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS:These issues addressed, I simply love the absence of a carafe, the convenience of single cup dispensing. No more worries about drips mid-brew (to grab a quick cup), and I dig the light guide for where the DCC-3000 is dispensing. Also, dispensing area is quite high, meaning you'd be hard pressed to find a mug incapable of fitting underneath the dispenser.Build quality of the DCC-3000 is very good, and disassembles easily for cleanup. The only irritant is the too small filter casing within the water reservoir. It seems a glutton for punishment in being such a tight fit.SUMMATION:Yes, there are better makes/models out there, but this is a novel coffee maker that does well at its price point. It appears (from my use) that some earlier hiccups were addressed in Cuisinart QA. Several months in, and the DCC-3000 continues to impress.**UPDATE - SEP 2012: I ran into some leaking, coffee inconsistency as described by other reviewers. In response, I pressed the spring/seals up/down on the water and coffee reservoir + ensured proper seating, also a clean movement of the dispenser within the main coffee reservoir area. Upon examination, it looked like the spring/gasket in the coffee reservoir might have shifted slightly, perhaps the culprit...? Would not be a surprise if this occurred in a dishwashing run.I called Cuisinart in tandem. Cuisinart was adamant x 100 in these problems stemming directly from calcification in the water reservoir gasket seal, recommended a 50/50 water/vinegar cleaning solution method (letting it sit in the water reservoir for 30 min unplugged). They advised running through that batch...then 2 or more until all the solution was gone. Also offered to solve any/all problems this didn't address (calling them back). I used the Urnex powder solution available on Amazon to accomplish the Cuisinart steps. All seems fixed.In short - if you're running into leaks and related, don't wait for the clean light to come out. The first time I saw it flash was ironically through a cleaning cycle (from some soap buildup). **** UPDATE - FEB 2014 **First, coffee starting leaking upon pouring; the unit would not disengage. After finagling the switch up/down, it thankfully stopped.Water reservoir was up to its no good tricks once again. Decalcification did not work. From observations, the spring (water release) at the bottom of the reservoir was no longer properly sealing/opening. Cuisinart sent a replacement, which seems to have done the trick. For now.**While I love the concept of this unit, I can't believe the amount of problems over a mere 1+ year period. While Cuisinart's customer service is both solid and knowledgable, I lowered my rating to 3 stars based on hassle factor.

First impressions, good tasting cappuccino, my favorite drink for about 3 decades now. So that's why we bought it.A little background, I was raised on San Francisco North Beach coffee before coffee shops came into vogue and way before Starbucks. I like good, strong coffee, and have owned many coffee espresso machines over the years. This machine is maybe TOO easy to use, taking some of the fun of brewing a good cup of java. But it ""brews"" coffee HOT, a feature lacking in many machines.Design-wise, it's odd-looking on the countertop, duck-like and inelegant. The 40 oz. carafe is awkward to fill...make sure you have a good grip.It came with 6 different samples. Coffee luongo (straight coffee) was the biggest disappointment. Demonstrator said that pods would be good from 6 oz. to 12 oz. NO WAY, maximum is 8 oz. before things get watered down to the point of unacceptable.So in order to get a decent sized cappuccino, you have to double the recipe. Which is what I do.As far as the quality of the lattes and cappuccinos, they're tasty. Slightly too sweet (for me) and too milky...but HOT, which I like. If you're a coffee aficionado, you may be disappointed.Boxes of pods average [...] Cafe Luongo (straight coffee) and Espresso have 16 servings per box. The other ""milk"" drinks have 8 servings per box (1 milk pod, 1 coffee per serving).All this means that cappuccinos and lattes are roughly [...]serving. 6 ounces isn't that big, 8 ounces isn't enough to get *me* started, so it takes 2 servings. What I'm getting at is that this particular system, while easy to use, is expensive compared to what you can do with an old-school espresso machine.Even if the machine were FREE, I figure it's 6-8 times as expensive compared to buying and grinding beans at Costco. Plus there's the storage space (3 weeks = 10 boxes or so), and quite a bit of non-recyclable waste.Including the cost of the machine, it is probably about the same as picking up daily coffee at Starbucks or Peets.Pros: Fun, no-brainer-easy-to-use, fairly tasty, creamy, HOT drinks.

AV1F8VNJPLPTL,B008J8MKP8,S. Smerud,"[21, 25]","The Hamilton Beach 33265 has all the basic features a slow cooker needs.  It has the essential warming feature, so dishes automatically stay warm if you're running late.  Timing can be programmed in half-hour increments.  The glass lid lets you see the progress.  A vent in the lid keeps it from rattling as steam escapes.  The non-stick lift-out insert allows searing on a range, and then simply set it in the slow cooker, saving the effort of cleaning a separate skillet.  Hamilton Beach claims the insert and lid can be washed in the dishwasher.However, the quality of the features is a little lacking.  The lift out insert handles may get too hot for some people.  The non-stick lift-out insert is a thin metal that will not conduct heat as evenly a most skillets.  On my first cooking effort, the non-stick coating bubbled a little on the sides, and a pinhead size of non-stick broke off of the bottom.  Soap suds will get under the handle when cleaning the lid.  While claimed to be dishwasher safe, the insert does not seem sufficiently durable to be washed in the dishwasher.Separate from the product itself, it is worth evaluating if the convenience of saving the effort of cleaning a skillet is worth it.  For example, a skilet has a large surface area for caramelizing onion, and produces a result you won't get by browning on a smaller non-stick surface of the insert.  It can take less time to clean a separate pan than it takes to stand over the slow cooker insert, and you'll get a better result with the separate skillet.Overall, the Hamilton Beach provides a lot of features at a reasonable cost.

I wanted to give the product sufficient time to convince me that it was ""above average"" but I really don't feel that it is. I get a similar quality of sleep as two white down pillows we have that I mentioned below by Pacific Coast from Costco, also made in the USA. In fact, I would go as far as to say my quality of sleep is better on the white down pillows.Although I very much appreciate that My Pillow is made here in the USA, I just cannot give it a raving review. I can recommend it as your average pillow in comparison to others... nothing more, nothing less. I have just not experienced all that it is advertised to be.************************************************************************************************************************************Update July 8, 2013:I've been using ""My Pillow"" for just over a month and, after careful review, I feel the need to downgrade my original review of ""5"" to a ""4"". I just don't notice any improvement, nor difference, from most of the pillows I've used in the past or currently own (i.e. white goose down by Pacific Coast).""My Pillow"" has not helped to relieve any of the chronic tension/stress pain I experience in my shoulder/neck area nor do I feel any improvement in my sleep. If this pillow was not made in the U.S. and was not well made, I would have changed my rating to a ""2"", largely due to the cost factor, but the fact that it does seem well-made & IS made here in the U.S. I'm going with a ""4"" rating because it does perform well as a ""pillow"", it just doesn't stand-out from other bed pillows I own (i.e. white goose down by Pacific Coast).**********************************************************************************************************************************Please note:Although I am a diehard Amazon customer, I did not buy my two king sized My Pillow pillows off Amazon. I was able to get a set of two My Pillow pillows (king size) off a popular, well-known TV shopping channel while the company CEO was on the show. They had a special running for a set of two pillows and there was also a 3 payment plan which really helped out my budget (drowning in student loans). I really wanted to try this brand of pillow but needed to save $$.Anyway,I just used my ""My Pillow"" for the first time last night, and my comments would, essentially, duplicate ""Kramer"" that was posted April 30, 2012.Upon arrival (which came directly from the manufacturer) I followed the enclosed instructions of fluffing the pillow in the dryer for 5 minutes before use (just air fluffed).I promptly placed it inside a king size pillow case. I noticed no odor, as some reviewers mentioned. It just smells like cotton material...almost no smell, and the pillow is quite comfortable to sleep on. It is supportive & did not flatten out during the night and I didn't hear any noticeable rustling noise, other than a normal sound you would hear when your ears are near any pillow made of fabric.And, as ""Kramer"" mentioned April 30, 2012, the initial ""feel"" suggests pieces of foam inside but when you sleep on it you don't sense any lumps at all.It is of course, still early, but my initial review would be very similar to ""Kramer"" April 30, 2012.If anything changes, I will be sure to update my review.BJ",3.0,"It's ""ok"" (downgraded previous rating)",1369958400,"05 31, 2013"

The spinning cup centrifugal juicers that first burst onto the market in infomercials are noisier and extract less juice and are less versatile. They are also less expensive.This juicer is the upright kind and has the advantage over my standard juicer I usually recommend (the Omega) because the feed tube is larger than an average carrot, which is the worst feature of the Omega (everything must be cut slimmer than a big carrot. EVERYTHING.) The footprint is about the size of a blender. The noise level is quiet--something that I appreciate. I hate high pitched, whining loud sounds of any kind.It can process wheatgrass, which the centrifugal type of juicers cannot do, also kale and other tough leafy vegetables. The low speed and mastication is said to retain more of the enzymes of the raw food as the juice is not heated by so much friction.Features:3HP reduced gear motor for slow, thorough extraction and allows various low speed methods, for example, with soaked soybeans..Low speed extraction methods - 80rpmCan make not only fruit or veg juice, but also homemade tofu, applesauce and other purees.Has a cleaning device to clean the mesh (always an issue)Chrome finish to blend into stainless steel designed kitchens.Cookbook with various recipes, including recipes for veggie-haters, ice pop recipes (very tasty-looking), jams, ketchup.

A2B06L9QXOFXJH,B0045I8E4W,Ryan,"[16, 17]","I purchased the Hoover Platinum Collection Lightweight Bagged Upright and it has proven to be a very good vacuum for the price.As soon as you take the vacuum out of the box, it lives up to its lightweight name.  It's a very easy vacuum to handle.  The construction of it is also very solid.  It feels well put together, and not super plasticky.  I also think the design of it is pretty attractive, for a vacuum.  When you turn it on, the motor starts slow and rev's up to full power, which is supposed to prolong the motor life, since it's less shocking to the electromechanical components than an immediate on-off.  The motor has a commercial-like sound to it, and is a decent volume; not the quietest out there, but it's not loud or shrill.  The vacuum has very strong suction and does a great job on carpets.  It can lay flat, and has a relatively low profile powerhead, so it can get under your bed pretty easily.  The bag is positively huge, and will take a while to fill up.I found performance on hard floors to be just ok.  I previously had a canister vacuum with a floor brush, and it did a much better job of getting into places than the Hoover.The reason this vacuum only gets 3 stars from me is because of the filtration.  I felt misled by the HEPA claims.  Note that only the BAG is HEPA compliant, not the exhaust from the motor!  I was wondering why my eyes were watering and nose was running when I was vacuuming, so I did some more research.  Like commercial vacuums, this is a ""dirty air"" vacuum wherein the debris passes through the motor's fan blades and then blows into the bag.  (In a clean air vacuum, the motor is after the bag and filter, and usually has a filter after the motor).  So with the Hoover Platinum, the dirt is passing through the motor, but there is no filter on the motor exhaust!  That's why my allergies were acting up.If you have severe allergies, I unfortunately cannot recommend this vacuum.  If you don't, however, it is an excellent, well-built cleaner for homes with wall to wall carpeting.",3.0,Great vacuum but not truly HEPA filtration,1344038400,"08 4, 2012"

It cleaned up nicely without swelling the first time I washed it--but I was careful not to let the board soak in the dishwater (just wiped it down and air-dried).At first, I was concerned about attaching the plastic feet, because it seemed like the screws at the bottom would protrude and scratch the glass, metal or Formica of my stove or counter surfaces. However, on closer inspection, it was evident that the screws would recess into the feet, as they were tightened. They slid into the slots quite easily and tightened with just a few turns of the screwdriver. You don't really need the feet, however, as the board has about 1 inch sides that lift it off the surface. The legs are really only needed to add height if you have raised burners on your stove top.When I tried it, the board actually got in my way. With a flat glass surface, I already use the side of the stove on which I am not cooking as a work area, so this was a bit redundant. It was not as easy to clean as my glass top, either. However, if you have raised electric or gas burners this would be a great help.I don't plan to use this as a cutting board, since I worry about bacteria getting down into the wood grain and not coming out with washing.

It looked exactly like my old pan, down to the indentation around the bottom of the pan to hold your roast or meatloaf from sitting in fat. Not a whole lot of fat, anyway. The indentation is pretty shallow.When the pan arrived, I was less than thrilled. It is very lightweight, compared to any of my older roasting pans, and can be ""flexed"" rather easily. It's about as heavy as say, two or three of those foil pans sold in supermarkets. I generally prefer something a lot more sturdy.The light weight could be an advantage for some: people who have a hard time lifting heavy pans will find this right up their alley, especially because the finish and construction of the pan was first rate. It does not appear to have any kind of non-stick coating on it (fine by me), so you'll need to grease it or use some pan spray with each use. I used this pan for our holiday turkey and it worked perfectly - it did not flex at all when I had the turkey in the pan, and did everything I expected from a roasting pan.For the right person, this could be a good roasting pan - anyone who is concerned about the weight of their cookware. People with disabilities or people traveling in mobile homes, both come to mind. Unfortunately, I prefer something with less flexibility and more weight to it, and will likely find a new home for it.

The only time I make waffles is for a crowd, so this double maker seemed to be a no-brainer, despite being more expensive then purchasing two single Waring Pro waffle makers at Costco. (to save on storage space). Unfortunately I can not use this on my island because the cord is TOO SHORT to reach the island's electric plug without being too close to the edge. (The cord only extends 22 inches from the waffle-maker, so if you have any over-hang at all on your island, be sure to measure first.... In addition, to use it on the kitchen counter, the upper cabinets are too low to allow the lid of the waffle-maker to open all the way, so finding a spot in the kitchen is tricky. If the cord was even 6 inches longer it would work perfectly on the island, (The single Waring Pro waffler's cord is long enough to reach the plug while sitting on my island, ).The other concern I have with this waffler is that when the batter is cooking and it expands, the waffle plates open and cause the waffler to separate. This happens no matter which side is up. (This does not happen with the single waffler) The only way I've been able to keep the iron closed is to turn it 180 degrees-so that the waffles are standing on their sides. Once the waffles are almost cooked, I can turn the iron back in normal position.On a positive note, this iron makes the best Belgian waffles I've ever had. I did a 'taste test' and using the same batter cooked waffles in my other wafflers. I tested the wafflers two days in a row, on the second day I used a different recipe  in case it was batter specific. Hands down, the Waring Pro won. (The waffle irons I used: two different Toastmasters wafflers-one belgian, one regular, and an Oster round Belgian waffler.

I use it every day to make tea.  Twice I took it with me on vacation to make hot cocoa and ramen noodle cups when I needed a snack (there's wasn't a microwave in our hotel room), and it's great for that too.  I always drain it out completely after each use and open the lid so it airs out.The bad?  It's a bit fussy.  No matter how much water I put in, it heats it for the same amount of time.  If I want to boil 1/2 cup or 1 cup of water, the Hot Shot will bring it to boiling... and then keep boiling and boiling until I'm worried it's going to boil itself dry.  I have to unplug it in these instances.  There's no way to turn it off other than unplugging it and when you go to plug it in next time, it'll automatically start heating up where it left off.  This is why there's a sticker on the Hot Shot telling you to fill it with water before you plug it in.  If it's heating with no water inside of it, it'll damage the Hot Shot.The Hot Shot says it will boil 16oz of water, but if I try to boil 14-16oz of water then it will boil over... the lid will jump up and boiling water will spray around.  I won't even be able to touch the dispenser without getting boiling water on my hand.  Dangerous.  (I can't let visiting guests use this Hot Shot on their own, at least not without a short lesson.)  Really, I can only use this Hot Shot with 12 oz water, that keeps it from boiling over.I can't use this Hot Shot to make 2 cups of tea, one right after the other.  When I press the start button to make the 2nd cup, it either won't start at all, or it will but it won't heat the water for nearly long enough.  It has to cool down after the first use, and only then can it be used to boil more water.  It's okay if you're just making tea for yourself, but not so great if a couple of your friends come over and accept your offer to make them tea.By the way, I use 14oz Corelle Hearthstone mugs and they're *just* a touch too tall for the Hot Shot.  I get it to fit by tilting the mug in under the Hot Shot's dispenser then tilting it carefully back out once I've dispensed the hot water.  It seems when they made the Hot Shot, they made it to fit 10-12 oz mugs, so that's something to keep in mind.So, I'll keep using this Hot Shot until the day it dies (and when that happens I'll be sure to update this review).

When we got it together there was one drawer front with handle holes in wrong spot and one door badly scraped.

They sent over night shipping ($84+) but it didn't come for 6 days via FedEx.  In the meantime, UPS came everyday to pick up the package being shipped back.  Due to the weight of this package, my husband & I, both in our 60's, were unable to haul it indoors.  The first one, my daughter and her husband drove 55 miles to come, bring in house and put it together for us.  So we left it on front porch and repackaged.

A2H5T88XL8YCPQ,B000FNEWAQ,Andrey,"[1, 1]","I was very skeptical about buying this grind/brew unit at first, but decided to experiment. My girlfriend has to get up at 5:30am for work, so at first we both really loved the fact that we could load the beans/water in the evening, and wake up to hot coffee - she at 5:30, myself at 8, from the same brew. The programming isn't too complicated and she was able to figure it out pretty quickly as well. We have been enjoying the unit for about 7 months now. The carafe is nice, keeps the coffee hot for a long time. The grinder seems to be decent - not good, not bad, just decent. The taste of the coffee is OK, better than most coffee makers I've had but not amazing.The reasons I am giving 3 stars to this unit are the following:1. After a while, the grinder jammed and it was not easy to clean it out. I made an attempt to take the grinder out and was able to clean it. But it was not easy at all - I am pretty sure the engineers behind this made every single attempt to make disassembly as difficult as possible.2. The display is losing lines. One line disappeared permanently, and there's another one that comes in & out.3. All of a sudden, we started finding ground coffee on top of the cover to the swinging drip pot. Turns out, when it swings out, it doesn't come out all the way - well, it does, but it doesn't stay there, it travels maybe 1/8th of an inch back towards the water container. This means that the hole in the cover doesn't align with the coffee dispenser! I carefully took the swinging mechanism apart and found a lot of plastic parts, one of them with a broken plastic tab, but that wasn't the cause of the problem, though. The cause of the problem seems to stem from the plastic wearing out and not fitting properly.Basically, this is a complicated, hard-to-repair unit with lots of plastic parts that will fail sooner or later. I can still have the unit grind/transfer/brew coffee fore me, just can't rely on the automatic grind-brew mechanism anymore. I have not tried without the cover off for fear of having the coffee grounds go everywhere. I most likely voided the warranty on it by taking it apart, but I really did not feel like dealing with looking for a box/shipping it/paying for shipping to have it repaired, and this is not what I expect from a 7-month-old unit for THIS much money.So take this review for what you will, but as an engineer, I say - simpler is better.",3.0,"Complicated, plastic all-in-one unit...",1305072000,"05 11, 2011"
A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,B008HPVFAE,Seek Felicity,"[0, 0]","I love mandolins and this is essentially a mandolin but for the creation of waffle pieces.  When I first opened the product I was a little disappointed.  Everything seemed, on the whole, flimsy.  This thought was reinforced when I first used the product.I first used this product to make waffle fries.  I used Russet potatoes that were at least five inches long.  Such a size (and weight) did not work well with this device.  Until the potato was cut down to about three inches, the safety holder could not easily hold the large potato as I moved it up and down the cutter.  Once close to 1 inch in size, the remaining hunk easily fell from the grip of the safety holder.  The weight of the potato and the pressure that I applied also caused the device to bend.It takes some practice to produce waffle like pieces.  I found it easier to make match stick pieces.  Often my waffle pieces broke apart into match sticks.  With other pieces of produce, small waffle pieces could be created as well.  The instructions highlight two ways to make different cuts.  Each involves different maneuvers of the hand.  I pretty much only found one way to cut the produce that yielded pieces big enough for dipping or baking.The unit is adjustable to three different heights.  It is not a difficult process.  The user squeezes the blade insert and pulls the insert to create a larger opening.  Sometimes, however, opening the insert can create instability, especially when using larger, heavier pieces of produce.This unit does not have other blades that can be inserted.  If you don't want waffle cuts or want a greater assortment of blades, you need to buy a different cutter.For most applications, I will probably stick to my regular mandolin that doesn't have fancy cuts involved.All in all, I found the safety holder to be lacking and I didn't like the flimsy nature of the cutter.This product is made in Germany.",3.0,"Bends easily, chopstick pieces more easily achieved than waffle pieces",1351555200,"10 30, 2012"

It replaced another Braun, which I owned for 15+ years.The only reason I replaced the old one was because I wanted a coffee maker with a thermal carafe.First the positives.  This coffee maker brews excellent coffee.  The taste is richer than I got from my oldcoffee maker.  The thermal carafe looks attractive on the table and it keeps the coffee hot for a reasonableamount of time.  I love that the power switch turns the coffee maker off after about 20 minutes and thatthis is a proper switch (versus a membrane switch).What I don't like is that the carafe has three little ""feet,"" which make it easy to incorrectly return thecarafe to the ""hot plate.""  In such situations the carafe is not sitting securely in its place and canconceivably fall on the counter or floor.  (This was never been an issue with my old coffee maker.)To be fair, the carafe hasn't yet fallen.  But it has happened that I incorrectly returned the carafe toits place in the morning.  One more clumsy move from me would have caused the carafe to fall.The solution is to inspect the carafe from all sides to ensure that it's properly in it's placein the coffee maker--or not to put the carafe back into the coffee maker with coffee in it.The other problem is that sometimes when I want to pour coffee while a fresh batch is being brewed,the stopper doesn't work properly and coffee pours out of the machine onto the hot plate and then thecounter.  This is also a new ""feature.""  It never happened with my old machine.  The solution is towait until the coffee is done brewing and all the coffee is in the carafe.Overall I don't regret getting this coffee maker.  However, I'd be happier without the annoyances.Updated Sep 21, 2009: I finally got sick of all the problems with this coffee maker (ex. most of them related to spills) and replaced this coffee maker with a BUNN NHBX-B(D) Generation High Altitude brewer.

Rose,"[22, 22]","=============================UPDATE (12/12/12)=============================I am slightly obsessed with screw-top food storage containers and recently purchased another comparable container, Glad LockWare. Of the 4 I have used, Glad is my new favorite, and the available sizes are just what I'm looking for. My new ranking:1. Glad LockWare (Glad Lockware Bags, Small, 3 Count (Pack of 3))2. Ziploc Twist 'N Loc (Ziploc Twist 'N Loc Containers, Small 2 Cup, 3 Containers & 3 Lids (Pack of 2))3. Rubbermaid TakeAlong Twist and Seal4. Ball Plastic Freezer Containers (Ball Plastic 8-Ounce Freezer Jars, 5 Pack)Glad is very similar to Ziploc but made of slightly thicker (sturdier) material, and it stacks better because of the raised circle on the lid. Plus, unlike Ziploc, there is an Extra Small size. Freezer, dishwasher, and microwave safe. BPA-free #5 polypropylene plastic.So far, all my containers have withstood dishwasher washing and freezing very well with no breakage...except for Rubbermaid. I've had a casualty in the dishwasher - I found one completely cracked. Rubbermaid may not be the sturdiest. Thankfully I've found a comparable replacement size with Glad.As for leakage, reviewers of all brands seem to have had different experiences. I have not had any leakage issues with any brand, but I normally use these in the freezer and not for travel. After I freeze small portions of food, I pop them right out (run containers upside down under running water for 2-3 seconds while pushing on the bottom) and store them in plastic bags. Saves a lot more space than stacking containers in the freezer. Ball is the toughest to pop frozen food out of because of the tall shape.=============================ORIGINAL REVIEW=============================I've now used 3 different screw-top plastic container products from 3 different manufacturers - Ziploc, Ball, and these Rubbermaid TakeAlong Twist and Seal containers. For the most part, they all have been nice to use.-Ziploc Twist 'N Loc Containers, Small 2 Cup, 3 Containers & 3 Lids (Pack of 2)-Ball Plastic 8-Ounce Freezer Jars, 5 Pack-Rubbermaid TakeAlongs 1-Cup Twist and Seal Containers, Pack of 4Pros & Cons, specifically for these Rubbermaid Twist and Seal containers:PROS:1. Spill-proof screw-on top (debatable, as many reviewers have had leakage problems)2. Dishwasher, microwave, freezer safe3. BPA-free4. Great for the priceCONS:1. Not much...a minor nitpick is that I wish the lids were sunk in, like the Ziploc.All 3 brands (Ziploc, Rubbermaid, Ball) are made of #5 polypropylene plastic, and feel about the same thickness. I like the feel of the Ziploc and Rubbermaid lids better than the Ball lids, as Ziploc and Rubbermaid have more surface area around the rim to hold while screwing on.Ball's containers are both stackable and lock together. The Ziploc and Rubbermaid lids are stackable, but they do not lock to each other. In addition, Ziploc's lids are sunk in more than Rubbermaid's so that they stack better.Out of the 3 brands, I like Ziploc the best, then Rubbermaid, then Ball. Although the Ziploc and Rubbermaid products are very similar, I prefer Ziploc's lids that are more sunk in so that they are stackable. Since Ziploc still does not have an 8-oz. version, I will be using these Rubbermaid containers until Ziploc adds an 8-oz. to their product line.

This is the first high-end vacuum I've had, and it's been a great help around the house. It looks and feels like a vacuum of the future. It's a pleasure to use, but it does have a couple of problems.The Verilux brand is new to me even though the style isn't. I used my mother's vacuum with a separate canister for years before moving out on my own. One of the biggest advantages of this style is that the main vacuum head is so lightweight and small. It's so lightweight, in fact, that I wondered about suction power. That hasn't been a problem at all, and it picks up just as much dirt as a regular model. The small, thin head goes places an upright simply can't. This head goes all the way back, completely level with the floor, so it will fit under a lot of furniture. It goes from carpet to hard flooring and back with no problem at all. All the attachments work beautifully and were easy to use. You do have to turn the head and canister on separately.The power cord is very short at about 20 feet long. Our rooms are not that big, and I have to move the plug for every room. If you have large rooms/a larger home, you'll either have to get an extension cord or get used to moving the plug around a lot. I don't understand why the cord is so short, or why there is no on board storage for the attachments. There will come a point where the attachments are lost or simply forgotten. When I want to do corners and hard to reach areas, I have to go to the closet. I feel that these are minor inconveniences considering the vacuum's overall performance, but some may have less patience for this sort of thing.The vacuum clogged on the fourth or fifth use over a 1500 square foot home. It turns out this thing does NOT like rubber bands. The most irritating part of it was that the sound barely changed to let me know that it was clogged-- the only way I could tell was there was no debris swirling around in the canister, and it was still picking up cat hair. I can see this thing overheating if you're not paying attention. When taken apart, it was difficult to tell where the problem was. We eventually used the plastic piece from aDrano Snake Pluskit to dig a very stubborn hairball entangled in a rubber band. It was in the area where the hose attaches to the canister. I've uploaded a photo so you can get an idea of what we were dealing with.There is a plastic cone filter in the canister that you must remove to clean. It's simple when you figure out that you just squeeze it a little and turn it counterclockwise to remove it. The problem is that the manual doesn't explain that-- or else doesn't make it clear. I spent quite a bit of time frustrated as I squeezed and pulled without turning. The HEPA-12 exhaust filter on the back of the canister must sit at an angle, not flat, to close the lid. This is also not explained anywhere and it took some maneuvering to get it right. Once you get removal and replacement correct, it's very easy to get the filters out to clean and change them.My biggest question was, does it really kill bugs, bacteria and germs? I suppose there's no way for me to know for sure without a microscope. The attachments do not have a UV light on them, so the only way to kill anything with this is with the vacuum head (or I suppose you could try whacking it with the wand, LOL). I don't recommend handling the head roughly, because the light is one of those new bulbs that needs special handling if you break it. It would be difficult enough to clean up a broken bulb on a hard floor; I don't know how you would get it out of carpet. That is one part I don't like it. I vacuum every day, and I haven't noticed a change in odors, good or bad. The instructions say you have to use the light to kill germs and so on, but it doesn't say how long to expose surfaces to the sanitizing light to get the effect.The bottom line is that I have floors that look clean, but I really don't know if I've killed or sanitized anything. It picks up enough dirt and is so lightweight that it's an overall five star vacuum, and I would heartily recommend it. My only caveat is that I cannot confirm or deny that it does *everything* the manufacturer claims.UPDATE 05/19/2012 I have to update this vacuum and reduce the rating to three stars. Either I have exceptionally dirty floors, or this thing is prone to hair/dust clogs. Did I say prone to clogs? I meant the hose clogs every single time I use it, sometimes before I even get halfway through the house. My husband has developed a method of swirling the hose around his head to get the hairballs out, kind of like Wonder Woman uses her magic lasso. The hairballs get stuck in the middle of the hose every time, in a place that is difficult if not impossible to reach with any sort of probe. When it's clear, I love this lightweight vacuum, but it clogs way too much for me to keep a five star rating on it.",3.0,"Excellent vacuum, not sure if it really sanitizes",1329004800,"02 12, 2012"

When my Oster Mykonos yogurt maker came however, it didn't include an instruction manual. I've never tried making yogurt before so I was kind of at a loss.I did call customer service to obtain a manual but at first the girl said she didn't have one for this model and it wasn't in the system...period. I told her it was probably new and asked if there was someone else that could look into it. Her manager told her that he would send the manual digitally to me within 72 hours and that hasn't happened. I also looked on the website for a manual but couldn't locate information for Oster's yogurt makers.So, my experience has been thus far, fairly good with this yogurt maker-with not having any idea how to use it. The first batch of yogurt I tried to make from an internet recipe failed. I did another search and found a recipe where I took four cups of milk and three tablespoons of yogurt that was NOT nonfat-(which isn't a very easy thing to find, by the way...). Anyway, after a couple of trips to the store and finding the yogurt that wasn't non fat - I boiled the four cups of milk and then I waited for the milk to cool to room temperature. I skimmed off the skin of the milk and then whisked the yogurt in. I read that it takes about 8 hours to create yogurt so I poured my mixture in the large container as well as all 6 of the jars and put the timer on 8 hours.I was actually pleasantly surprised when I made perfect yogurt with the little knowledge that I gleaned from Google. I mean, the yogurt couldn't have been more perfect! It was firm and very tasty. The strainer for the larger container in the set worked very well straining off any liquid. I really enjoy the yogurt from that recipe.I also thought it would be to my benefit to obtain a yogurt book for different recipes but the book I ordered turned out to be a recipe book that includes yogurt in the food dishes so again I failed to obtain some sort of recipes where I could actually make some different types of yogurt using different types of milk and so on.My overall impression is that I do like this yogurt maker quite a bit and I can be satisfied to use my one recipe that I've been successful with which I will use a lot if it's the only reliable recipe I can come across. I'll continue to experiment and see how things turn out, tho that can be frustrating when you use ingredients you have to toss if it doesn't turn out.Oster, if you read this: your customer service needs improvement.

A26XMCAS33TQF7,B002AQSWMA,Sandy Toes,"[1, 1]","This is a carbon steel pan. It ships with a lacquer coating that MUST be removed before any cooking is done and the pan WILL rust if it isn't seasoned before using. That's an absolute. I'm a big fan of carbon steel pans, favoring them over cast iron because of their lighter weight and quick heating on my GE induction range. As with all proper steel woks, this pan is very thin and lightweight. This really cuts down on heating and recovery time. Practically speaking, this translates to a much faster recovery when a load of veggies or handful of cold meat is tossed into it. That means food can sear instead of steaming in a too-cold pan. This is necessary for a proper stir fry, and this pan succeeds here.Sadly, this pan works against itself. The thin steel that makes it great for stir fry makes it prone to warping. Mine did, as others have noted theirs did, too. I think it's because of the relatively wide base of this pan. Most woks have really high sides compared to their bases and I think this makes it harder for them to warp. At 7&#34;, it's much wider than normal for a 12&#34; wok, with walls that are almost normal for a wok.I can fit more food into it without crowding, which is why I purchased it for my new induction range. I was hoping for two pans in one, a hybrid between a traditional wok and fry pan, for use on my new induction range. Even though it is very badly warped, it still works, heating lightning quick, all over. it's just become a little more awkward to use.  It would be fine on a gas range. I use it frequently, for stir fries and for general veggie saut&eacute;s. Eventually I'll replace it, but for now, it's ok, and as I said, it still works just fine.If you like the wide base, consider instead the similar Joyce Chen Pro Chef Peking Pan, in uncoated steel. It is made of slightly heavier steel and seems to not be prone to warping. No one's complained of it anyway, in 19 reviews.

I tinkered with recipes, figuring I must be doing something wrong.I would have to finish the loaves in my ""big oven"", to brown and finish baking the tops.  That defeats the whole purpose of an automatic bread baker, IMO.Within a few weeks of the purchase, I became ill, and was hospitalized for a month. When I returned home, I wasn't able to use the machine for another 4-6 weeks, do to my medical condition. When I resumed baking, and saw how the loaves weren't browning properly, and the tops were uncooked, I contacted Zojirushi C.S. I explained my dilemma, and they were not very helpful at all. Amazon C.S. Offered a ""partial refund"" If I were to return the huge machine to them.  I think my machine was defective, as other people I know love their Zos.I bought a Breadman 2 & 1/2 lb machine and could not be happier.Baking bread ""from scratch"" is not new to me. Years ago, I baked bread twice a week, every week. I took pride in the quality and varieties of the bread I made.Well times changed, and I rarely bake bread anymore.

But if you house is older and/or has non-standard (i.e. 1 3/4"" thick) doors, like mine, keep reading.I suppose I'll get the good stuff out of the way first - the hooks are sturdy, large, and have rubber caps on them, so they can handle large loads while also preventing them from slipping off. There's also rubber that covers every point of contact with the door to avoid scratches.Now the bad news. My house is older and still has most of the original wooden doors, which are 1 3/8"" wide instead of the modern standard 1 3/4"" and have some decorative recessed panels. This combination plays havoc with the rack.The rack has two springy arms on the hooks (if you look at the picture you can just barely see the one on the left hook). These are 1 3/8"" away from the back of the hook, and can be bent to accommodate a door up to 2"" thick. However, since my doors are the 1 3/8"", when I install the rack there's no spring tension to keep it in place. What's worse, since the rack's horizontal portion actually fits inside one of the recesses, the whole rack sits at a slight angle. This in turn causes top to angle up, which prevents the door from closing. Since the top of the hook wasn't meant to contact anything, it's not rubber-coated and scratches the door frame.I moved the rack to a door that does not have the recesses, but since the door is still the bare minimum size this rack can accommodate, it still does not hold securely.While the rack itself is good, and works well when you get it on the right door, OXO really needs to specify what thicknesses this will work well on rather than making a blanket statement that this will fit all doors without damage.

I used to own a small one from another company that I was pretty happy with. My reason for buying this one is that I wanted an upright unit instead of a small one with just hand tools. This one has both, which is definitely useful.My reasons for docking it a couple of stars:1) The hand tools have to be manually attached any time you wish to use them, and manually removed when you want to use it as an upright unit. This is a convoluted multi-step process that involves disassembling and reconfiguring the dirty water tank each time. It would have been much nicer if the hand tools were somehow permanently attached and you could just flick a switch or move a lever to use those instead.2) It has a lot of parts, each of which has to be used in a specific way, so there's a learning curve to this thing before you can use all of its features comfortably.3) It has a lot of moving parts that snap into place. These seem like they are likely to break sooner rather than later.4) The instruction booklet could use a bit of love. It's not very well organized or written (contact and hire me to rewrite it, Hoover!), making it a bit difficult to find the instructions you need.5) The cord is attached at the bottom of the unit. This is just poorly thought out. I would like to go on record henceforth as having the opinion that all power cords should be attached at the top of any upright cleaning tool. That way nobody will ever have to bend over to retrieve the cord from the floor or to reposition the cord during cleaning.

Its a lot more fun, I know the ingredients involved, and feel I can make it more suiting to my palette and dietary needs. Salt and pepper are essential in any kitchen and should always be at arms reach.The Bodum Bistro Automatic Gravity Grinder works very well and as described. You just tilt it one way or the other for pepper or salt. In the center of the grinders on each side are little dials that you can change for fine to course grade, depending on how you like or what the dish might call for. I found it to be very sensitive in its activation. A tilt here and there and it starts going.On the plus side, its attractive, weighty and well designed. The ""red"" color is the one I received and the exterior is a rubbery plastic that has a light grip feeling, which is really nice. It does take 6 AAA batteries, not included. Three batteries for each shaker. Although it comes pre-loaded with salt and pepper, its pretty easy to refill. Its simple to use and works great.On the detracting side, I found it a little too sensitive and seems more for kitchen table use, and less for cooking use. This I  mean because if you want to put some in boiling water, or spice some meat, it comes out at a pace that might too slow for some. The design of it in a cooking setting might seem cumbersome or awkward to flip it around or flip-flop back and forth versus just grabbing a pinch of salt out of a bowl or a pour container if you need more than just a touch at the table. And then there is the price. It retails near $60, while Amazon has it currently at $40. Whether this is a deal or not is subjective, but I think most people are content with simple shakers that work just as effectively, not to mention I already have about 3 or 4 different means of getting salt and pepper as it is. It may not grind them up to varying sizes, but I think that is a particular for each person. Also, I did want to point out that when I did change the grades of the sizes, it was hard to determine the change from one to the next. There are like 6 sizes to choose from and so, unless you are searching for that perfect size, then I dont know if that many are needed.So is this a practical tool? I think in the right kitchen it probably makes for a visually nice item. Or maybe some fine dining restaurant it might be a handy tool for those who want a particular quantity. I dont know if this is something chefs would seek out to use. And I dont know if those more culinarily educated in their own kitchen would find this the ultimate item to make spicing their meats or pasta quicker or easier in the flow of things. So for me personally, I have not found it the ""goto"" item in my kitchen, but I will keep it around and see how frequent the need for it comes along.",3.0,"A Clever, Attractive Device - But is it Practical?",1307059200,"06 3, 2011"

That was until this weekend when I hit the power button and it depressed all the way inside and popped off into the nether regions of the machine.  I guess this is a relatively common problem after reading some of the comments here.  Called the ""local"" authorized repair center (about 80 miles away in Orlando) and they said they can look at it but if something inside was broken (such as the fitting that held the power button in place), they couldn't fix it because Krups doesn't make parts for it. So I'd be paying shipping, plus the diagnostic fee, to potentially have them tell me that there was nothing they could do.Needless to say, I was very aggravated since it was in otherwise perfect working order, and seemed like SUCH a waste to dump it for one stupid little plastic part that broke that probably cost Krups about 50 cents to begin with.  There HAD to be a way around this without shelling out $60-100 for a new grinder, right?  So I determinedly checked out the insides through the hole left from the broken button and saw a freshly broken plastic surface where indeed, the button had once been attached (kudos to the cheap plastic parts, Krups!).  I also found the ""master"" power switch/button inside that the broken button hits when you press it to turn it on (just to the right of the blue light bulb), and by pressing it myself with a pen, it turned on like normal.  Other than the cosmetic defect, the unit works just fine, and the minor inconvenience of having to use a pen to turn it on isn't so bad that I'd want a new machine.The broken button is still rattling around inside, and there's only one screw I can find, quite hidden, on the bottom.  This backs up the ""specialty tool"" the repair guy told me about that opens the unit up.  Anyway, it looks like if you unscrew it, the unit slides apart length-wise, so I might take it to Lowe's and see if they sell a micro-screwdriver that'll do the trick.  Until then, at least it works and I saved myself the money of buying a new one. Better believe I'll be looking at other models though, when that day comes.  Again, the grinder itself is perfect for this price range, and unless you're an over-the-top connoisseur, you be perfectly happy with the quality of the grinds...it's just that obviously Krups isn't putting much investment in its manufacturing.",3.0,"Another power button break, but got it working again.",1264377600,"01 25, 2010"

A1MW2HEG4LF56B,B001L5TVGW,S. Mariconda,"[8, 8]","When I visited my mother-in-law last fall, she had this oven. I fell in love with it over the week we were there and looked into buying one when I got home. At first I balked over a $250 toaster oven and hesitated to buy it. I read reviews, and saw that a not insignificant amount of reviews mentioned the oven dying within months of purchase. Even my mother-in-law said she had an issue when she cooked an entire chicken and the supports for the rack broke and it fell down and had to be replaced. But I figured, what are the chances? It's a great toaster oven and I'll take a chance.  Well ...We grew to love this toaster oven and used it several times a day. It preheats FAST and much faster than my full-sized electric oven. Because of how big it is, I don't think we had to use the actual oven in the 2 months our Breville worked, and it saved time. I never liked toaster ovens in general because I thought they heated unevently, but this one hasn't had that problem and my food comes out great. The only issue with cooking is that I think the toaster settings could go higher.  I like my toast lightly toasted - I mean, lightly golden with no evidence of burning whatsoever. And to get my toast like that, I need to have it on setting 6 of 7, where I'd have a regular toaster on the lightest setting.  Perhaps it's because of the dense, whole grain bread I use, and that if I'd used flimsy white bread it would take a lower setting. But if you were looking for really dark toast, I'd think a regular toaster would do a better job. It also takes a lot longer than a toaster - I think for 2 slices on setting 6 it was 5+ minutes.I do wish the setting dials would respond faster.  When I try to change it between settings after the oven has been idle, I find myself turning it a few times before it ""wakes up"" and responds to the fact that I want it to do something. Not a big deal, but a noticeable issue. I love how large it is, and that it is now for the most part an oven replacement. Very easy to clean, and even things that got burned on (like cheese) don't leave black stains like in my old oven. About a week ago I said to my husband that despite the insane cost, I was glad we invested in it, as it truly is a great oven.Then on Saturday I put a pizza in to cook, walked away, and 10 minutes later came back to a dead oven and a half cooked pizza. I thought it might be the outlet (I just had the washer/dryer going, so maybe I overloaded a circuit?), but I moved the plug to 4 different outlets and it was still dead, as if it was not plugged in. I checked the circuitbreakers and everything was fine.  I plugged something else in all those outlets, and it worked just fine.  So it was definitely the oven dying, just like many of the reviews mentioned. We received the over 12/18 and it died on 3/2, 10-1/2 weeks later.Had to wait until Monday to call Breville. Waited on hold for 35 minutes and started a claim with Omarr. After giving him some preliminary info, we got disconnected. Thankfully Omarr was smart enough to call me back right away. We finished the claim, and I told him how on Amazon that there were a LOT of reviews about this happening. He admitted that it had happened a bit with an earlier model, but that my oven was a newer model (he said the exterior looks the same, but the internal stuff was changed a bit), and that this was only the second time he'd heard of it happening.  (For the record, our ""batch #"" - engraved # on the back of the oven - is 1222.) While we were on the phone he sent an email with a FedEx slip to return the oven at no charge to me, and said that once the oven was received by them, they would ship out a new one.I shipped it out and they estimated that it would take a week to get to the New York address that the oven was being returned too. However, even though Omarr said that they would need to get it back first, I got an email from him with a tracking number that they shipped my new oven out yesterday (2 days after I had called and mailed back the broken one). I did reply to his original mail with the packing slip and confirmed to him that I had mailed it, so maybe they were able to check the tracking that it did, indeed, go out and trusted me. Tracking info says that the new oven should be to me by next Monday, which is exactly one week from when I first called them. Omarr was a great, responsive customer service rep and I'm very happy with the service I received from him. And I don't think a week's turnaround to get a new oven is unreasonable at all.Hopefully the new oven will work well, and more than 2-3 months. I'll update the review if I have any further problems.In summary, the oven itself (when it works) gets 5 stars from me. Their customer service gets 5 stars. The fact that the oven died so soon and the hassle of having to package it up and ship it back get 1 star. So I've averaged this out at 3 stars. If you do decide to take a chance on this, save the shipping box until the warranty runs out, just in case!Update: New oven arrived 3/11, one week after I had shipped out the broken one. The first thing I noticed is that the knobs have an entirely different feel to them - in my review I mentioned the sluggish response and how I'd spin them until it ""woke up"" - that's not the case with the new one. I did notice though that the knob to set the time does feel like it gets ""stuck"" at some point. I'll be curious to see if this becomes a problem, or if the loose knobs on the other was indicative of the problem it did have. We'll see.

It is lightweight and slim, using less space than our previous pitcher. Plus, the Filtrete's model features a perfect, snug-fitting lid. As per the manufacturer's description of a ""revolutionary fast flow filtration"" that works three times faster than ""traditional filtering pitchers"": refilling the water supply is lickety-split. As far as the ""holds more water than traditional filtering pitchers that are the same size"" goes, not sure about that part of the manufacturer's description. Our household overdoses on water; ""more"" never seems to be enough!I also like the replacement indicator on the lid that turns red when you must change the filter (just over one month). However, I do not like the $12 price for a new filter--the cost is at least twice that of a Brita filter. Perhaps this is the reason for the better than great tasting water that results; after a household consensus, we all agree that this water tastes fresher than Brita's water.Expensive water filters aside; my biggest complaint is the construction of the pitcher.

A3NEAETOSXDBOM,B00FSKOVFM,Stephen M. Charme,"[1, 1]","I received three separate units over time  at no cost in exchange for writing a review. The third unit finally had decent performance&#8212;though no better than units costing less than half the price. So let's take a look at this product.1. This is a cool mist humidifier where the mist shoots straight up. There is no way to direct it to the side--such as toward beds--as is possible on much less expensive humidifiers.2. There are four settings--standby, low, high and automatic.Auto mode turns on--but turns off too soon: Auto mode is supposed to start the Roolen when the humidity is below 40% and shut it off around 50%. But that's not what happened on my current Roolen. The auto mode sensor (located underneath the base, so don't place the Roolen on carpeting or the sensor won't work) did turn the Roolen on when the humidity was 30%. But the sensor was &#34;fooled&#34; by the mist coming out and turned off the Roolen too soon. I put a hygrometer next to where the sensor is and the Roolen shut off when the hygrometer went over 50%. Only problem was that the actual humidity in the room was only about 36%, which is what the hygrometer showed when I moved it a few feet away.3. I live in the Northeast and only use a humidifier at night during the winter months when I turn off the heat, which also turns off the automatic humidifier attached to my gas furnace. The humidity in my house is set to 30%; at 35% my windows start having ice condensation during the day, and at 40% nail heads start popping from studs (hard lessons I learned as a homeowner).Even when I ran the Roolen for 12 hours (7pm to 7am) the humidity in the 10&#8217; x 12&#8217; guest room where I tested it  never went above 37%.  So even if the auto sensor had worked properly, it wouldn't have mattered because the 50% level was never reached.4. Roolen says this unit works in a room up to 400 sq. ft., but based on my experience using it in a room that was only 120 sq. ft., I seriously doubt this product will have much of an effect in anything beyond 150 sq. ft.5. The button to switch between the four modes as indicated by the indicator light is located on the back side of the humidifier instead of on the same side as the indicator light--which is where it is on every other humidifier I have owned.  Just not convenient.6 . A more serious design defect is that you cannot see how much water is left in the tank without physically removing the cover on this unit. That's just ridiculous. No other humidifier I have ever used works like that.7. At this price level I expected a digital readout of the humidity level in the room and a way to choose a specific humidity level--but there are no such controls.8. If you don't hold it PERFECTLY STRAIGHT, water will drip out of the bottom. I placed it at a 45 degree angle in my bathroom sink, and the entire unit emptied out of the bottom--even though the plug on the water tank was still screwed on tight.Roolen's project manager confirmed that due to the way the Roolen is designed, there's no way to avoid leakage once you fill up the water tank, attach it to the base and carry the Roolen to wherever you want it unless you carry it perfectly straight. The leakage is not from the water tank, but the base.But here's my solution. Fill the Roolen, carry the water tank and base separately, and DON'T attach them until you put the base down where you want it.What about carrying a partially filled Roolen back to the sink to refill it? Leakage doesn't seem to be as much of a problem unless you really tilt the Roolen.Bottom line: While this is attractive, this works no better  than an &#34;ugly&#34; $50 humidifier  you can buy in the drugstore.  And the Roolen lacks several  features of that &#34;ugly&#34; humidifier--ability to direct the mist, ability to see the water level, and no leakage issue. You'll have to decide for yourself how much a stylish design, which the Roolen certainly has, is worth to you. I think this unit is very overpriced for what you get (and what you don't get) no matter how stylish it is.",3.0,Works okay (though not on auto) but is very overpriced,1383868800,"11 8, 2013"
A1QXE7OX7MSL2H,B000RY1G7A,"M. Gondek ""cenmad""","[1, 1]","UPDATED REVIEWFast-forward more than a year and half after buying this flatware.  I'm still very happy with the weight, balance (see caveat below), and looks of this set.  However, two factors have taken two stars off my original rating.1.  I find that the metal spots VERY easily, and the spots are difficult to remove.  I've never had this problem with other sets, so I have to assume it's this flatware.2.  The knives have slowly driven me crazy.  They don't balance at all well, and they tip over at the slightest nudge.  If you're balancing them on the plate edge, good luck getting them to stay there.  (Plates with a wide lid may not have this issue)  They're also very bottom-heavy (unlike the rest of the set), so they regularly slide off the plates when we carry dirty dishes to the kitchen.  Food stains on the carpet and floors then become another part of cleaning up after dinner.So all that said, I can't recommend these in good conscience.  We're actually going to be buying a new set because of the issue with the knives.ORIGINAL REVIEWI was worried about buying flatware without being able to gauge the weight and balance, but let the reviews here convince me.  Like others, I'm very happy I bought this set.  All the pieces are well-balanced and look great with both traditional and contemporary settings.  The way the knife sits on its edge is a little unnerving at first, but it's actually a very eye-catching design, and a nice touch on the table.  Unlike some, I haven't had any trouble with the shine - I did add rinse agent to my dishwasher just after buying these, so that might help.  One minor quibble is that the salad and dinner forks look nearly identical - just slightly different sizes - so it can take a second to sort them into the drawer. But this is very minor!  Highly recommended.",3.0,"Beautiful, heavy, balanced - UPDATE not recommended",1345680000,"08 23, 2012"
AX05DBU8IRUWY,B00K4V4EWA,C. Schmidt,"[0, 1]","*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for AYL and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Having reviewed and continuing to use a the similar product,DeluxIce Ice Ball Mold, I was quite interested in seeing the AYL offering.  Especially the quad mold, the desire for which is something I'd voiced before.  Sadly, the AYL design of both products is pretty lacking compared to the other.Starting with the larger 2.5"" mold, which is the same as the DeluxIce version.  The material is very thick, giving the impression of a better quality product.  It feels more sturdy, especially when working on getting the ice ball out.  The problem with it is the opaqueness of the material itself.  Why?  Because you have to guess/experiment with how much water goes into the mold.  The instructions say to fill to 1/4"" from the top.  Ever try judging a 1/4"" of depth while looking into a dark hole? The DeluxIce model on the other hand is semi translucent and has a visible ring as an indicator to the max fill.  This makes filling the mold with the proper amount of liquid so that you get a full ice ball without any/much overflow a lot easier.  The AYL mold does work, sure, no question.  I personally don't think the design is as good.Now for the 4pc mold.  A bummer that it only makes smaller 2"" ice balls, but that's not a major let down.  Again, it's the design that sucks.  Unlike the 2.5"" molds, the quad is a good deal more floppy instead of firm.  The instructions tell you to fill the lower half of the mold to the fill point, then press the top mold down on top.  The excess water is supposed to fill the top mold and an excess will spill over into the crevices of the top mold.  Yes, that kind of describes what happens.  What really happens is the the water spills out the the sides too, creating a mess if you didn't do this in the sink.  Because of the floppy nature of the material, the top portion of the mold doesn't seat firmly with the bottom and stay there.  To get it to work right, a weight place on the top of the assembled mold was needed to keep the top from floating up.  Again because of the material, the weight of the water in the mold causes it to flex and bend, increasing the chances of spilling it all while on the way to the freezer or placing it inside.  Once you have it all in there, yes, it will make ice balls, but in my opinion this is a very poorly thought of way to go about it.Given the (current) dollar difference between the AYL and DeluxIce products, you do get more with the extra buck, but, the overall product just isn't as good.  Myself, having been using both for almost a month, I'll take the DeluxIce version over the AYL.",3.0,"How to make a mess, in 3, 2, 1",1401062400,"05 26, 2014"

It has a small retractable brush that is very useful for car cleaning, and a plastic nozzle that can flip forwards to extend the reach, which is good for cleaning things high up and sucking up bugs.Apparently this device has a smart charger which does not simply keep the battery at full charge all the time but optimizes the recharging to extend the battery life. I have certainly not noticed any deterioration in the battery in the several months I have owned this vacuum.Opening the device to empty out the dirt is easy.

A3D9NUCR4RXDPY,B002IBACDE,Kathleen San Martino,"[3, 4]","This is a nice lightweight bagless vacuum but the attachments need improvement. Below are the PROS and CONS.PROS:- Assembly is a cinch - just insert upper handle into base and screw in two screws.- The vacuum is relatively lightweight.- It comes with a full set of attachment tools for use with or without the bendable wand.  Besides the bendable wand, the tools you get are a crevice tool, TurboBrush, floor tool, dusting brush, and an extension wand. Of course, all tools except for the bendable wand need to be stored elsewhere (meaning not on board the vacuum).  There is an option (according to one part of the manual--which contradicts instructions in another part of the manual) to wedge the crevice tool behind the bendable wand storage area but I found that an ineffective storage location.- The floor tool has a very soft roll bar in the center that won't scratch your floors when using it.- The vacuum picks up a lot of dirt because of the tremendous suction.- The HEPA filter and pre-motor filter are extremely easy to get to and replace or clean.- The dirt canister is easy to remove and empty.  However, if you have pets, pet hair will get caught in the upper part of the unit and have to be pulled out by hand.  Also, any rotary brushes you use (the one on the unit and the TurboBrush) will have to be cleaned frequently for hair removal.  The plastic cover on the TurboBrush is easy to remove for cleaning.- The vacuum has an automatic height adjustment, so you can go from rugs with various piles to bare floors without turning any dial.- The beater bar (rotary brush) doesn't start turning until the vacuum is in the reclining position for vacuuming.  Pushing the power button is all you need to do to put this brush in standby mode for when you are ready to vacuum the rugs. If you move off the rug and onto the floor, then just press the brush button to turn off the rotary brush.- The front of the vacuum has bumper guards so that if you hit furniture it won't leave a scratch.- Since the footprint of the vacuum is a few inches smaller than the standard size vacuum, you may be able to vacuum between chair legs and other furniture you normally can't get to with a full-size vacuum.- When vacuuming you are able to clip the power cord to the back part of the upper handle thereby keeping it out of the way.- There's a storage area in the back of the unit to wind the power cord around which has an easy cord release feature.CONS:- The cord is pretty long for a lightweight unit; however, it's about 2 feet shorter than full-size vacuums.  Some may find this a problem.- There's no light on the base of the unit like most full-size vacuums.  I don't care about this feature but you might.- The attachment tools do not store on the vacuum, instead you store them in the tool bag provided.  I don't care about this feature but some might find it a negative.- The attachments are difficult to ""attach to"" and ""remove from"" the vacuum hose (fit is too tight) and they are difficult to work with.  In fact, working with the attachments is downright cumbersome, even if you attach the bendable wand.- The vacuum hose is tightly woven in accordion style.  Therefore, you are able to increase the reach of the hose but the lightweight vacuum keeps falling over because the hose wants to recoil back into its original position.- Allergy sufferers will encounter dust when emptying the dirt container. Also, if you have pets, a lot of the hair has to be pulled out by hand from the container because it just doesn't ""fall"" out.Overall, this vacuum is a great lightweight upright unit with tremendous suction.  However, if you are a frequent user of the attachments, I suggest you consider another vacuum. If you have allergies, you might also want to consider a vacuum that has a bag. If you rarely use the attachments and want a bagless vacuum with great suction, then this might be the best vacuum for you.",3.0,5 Star Lightweight Upright Vacuum with 3 Star Attachments,1261353600,"12 21, 2009"

Had this not been offered to me by Amazon, I probably wouldn't have bought it - or a K-cup machine. I guess I just don't understand the excitement about K-Cup coffee makers. Yes, they are easy to use; that I understand but they are, not only environmentally wasteful (those K-cups are not fully recycleable). Besides they are expensive. More about that in a minute.I'm a guy who likes HOT coffee and there is virtually no modern coffee that makes HOT coffee except for a K-cup machine. So, again, I tried this and, yes, the coffee is hot, but you only get one cup at a time. Is the coffee tasty? It depends on which brand of K-cups you use and how much water you use. Isn't it interesting that the SAME SIZE K-cup makes a small, medium or large coffee? The SAME little K-cup.Well, this Mr. Coffee does nearly everything the more expensive Keurig machines do, so that's important if you are a K-cup fan. I had no problems with it at all. And the coffee samples that came with it are decent.But, when you buy this or any other K-cup remember that you need to buy the pods. Yes, they sell them at Costco and other places at a discount but I've yet to see a unit cost per pod of under 50 cents. So that's 50 cents for one cup of coffee. A pound of coffee makes about 30 10oz cups of brewed coffee. So if you paid $15./pound for the HIGH END Starbucks, you would pay the  same 50 cents. But if you buy coffee like Eight O Clock or even Green Mountain, at about $7.99/lb it would be less.My prediction is that the K-kups are a fad but I could be wrong.Back to this Mr. Coffee model., I think it's fine for the price.

A2PAK8O3X87ZUY,B000MT519O,K. Wise,"[6, 6]","Consumer Reports recommended this iron for ""avid sewers.""  I am a beginning sewer and did learn right away that having a good iron at hand is essential.  Because the steam in this unit is produced in the tank which is connected to the iron by a long hose, condensation will form in the hose when it sits idle which must be cleared from the line before good, clean steam is available.  I get that.  If I was using the iron for big ironing projects, I might have loved it, it IS amazing what this thing does to wrinkles, and the way it can lay in a crease.  But using it for sewing, I iron a seam, say, every 5 minutes, which is enough time for the condensation to have formed again.  Each and every time I used it I had to blow that huge drippy mess out of the iron.  My ironing board cover was a mess even though I kept a towel handy trying to catch the mess (without burning myself from the steam).  Doing it so often I guess I was less thorough and would consistently get wet spots on the item I was ironing.It became so frustrating that I returned it.  It is a shame because without the drippy mess issue that baby sure can iron.  I am not totally convinced that spotting would not be an issue with continuous use, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, I just did not do continuous ironing often enough to fully test it on that score.Apparently some other sewers are quite happy with theirs.  I would be interested to hear how their experience differed from mine.Two other quick notes.  They do want the tank emptied between uses, which is a bigger deal than with a standard iron because you're managing the iron, the tank, the water line, the power cord, the cap you have to screw off -- after releasing all of the steam from the tank (danger, danger! -- do NOT screw off that cap with pressure in the tank!).  Lastly, the bottom of the tank releases a lot of heat.  I had it on a wood surface before I realized how hot it was so I got a cooling rack from the kitchen, and a cutting board on top of that to place underneath the tank in order to dissipate enough heat so as not to damage my nice wood desk.OK, one more thing to be aware of, you will use up some real estate housing the tank as it can't live on the ironing board.  My board has one of those extensions to theoretically keep an iron on and had I kept it I was gonna have my very handy husband see if he could re-engineer it to accommodate the tank in order to free up precious table space in my work room.  OK, one last little thing, I thought people were being a little picky re the unviewable water tank, but it is a hassle, what were they thinking?p.s. the 3 stars are because I wasn't sure my experience would be universal and didn't want to bugger the ratingsp.p.s.

When I opened it, there was a strong smell of plastic so I immediately boiled a vinegar/water solution in it.  It took 6 minutes to boil 8 cups, which is reasonable.  But beware, don't boil 8-1/4 cups because it WILL boil over and if that happened when unattended it could have caused an electrical hazard.The pitcher is stylish (mine is red) but honestly it looks like a cheap piece of plastic.

A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,B004JJKO5O,Seek Felicity,"[29, 31]","The Sienna is an easy-to-set up device that is ready to steam, clean, and sanitize in five minutes and in just six easy steps:1)Remove Sienna from box and discard excess bags/packaging.2)Find and attach the Sienna's head to the body of the mop using a tiny, included screw.3)Find and attach one of the two included cleaning covers to the steam mop's head.  Pull the drawstring on the cleaning cover to tighten the cover over the mop head.4)Quickly and easily fill the water compartment on the Sienna by pushing down on the water container's handle.  Distilled water is not required according to the manual. Note:  The removal of the water container needs to be done with care as the water container is made of a brittle plastic.  You have to depress the handle - you cannot just pull the compartment out.5)Depress button on the Sienna's handle for 30 seconds to prep the machine on the first use.  A very loud noise may emit from the machine.  This is normal.6)(Try to) push the Sienna across the floor.Out of the box, the Sienna is a nice, sleek looking machine.  It is marketed for use on hard floors and carpet.  I appreciated that the machine was essentially put together when it arrived.  As noted above, I had mine ready to clean in five minutes.  The set-up process is relatively intuitive.  However, if you have never used a steam mop, here are some important points:  1) distilled water is not needed (always check this on steam cleaners for floors and fabric steam cleaners and if you have hard water, opt for distilled), 2) always test floors, especially wood floors, for tolerance to steam.  (Unsealed wood floors should not be subjected to cleaning with the Sienna). 3) The manual recommends that the Sienna not be plugged in the same outlet as high wattage devices to avoid a circuit overload. The Sienna is a 1500 watt appliance.My house has wood, tile, and vinyl flooring.  My wood flooring is not suitable for steam cleaning as it was installed in an era when sealing was not the norm.  My vinyl and tile flooring, however, is a pain to wash by hand.  I previously owned theEureka Enviro Hard-Surface Floor Steamer,313A, which worked great for tile but became too hot for my vinyl flooring and actually removed the top layer of vinyl if I left it in a spot longer than several seconds.  The Sienna reaches a temperature of 212 degrees.  According to the manual, for adequate cleaning, the device should be left on a spot for a minimum of eight seconds but no longer than 15 seconds.  I was able to leave the Sienna on a spot of vinyl for eight seconds without it damaging the flooring.What I didn't like about the Sienna:1)Can't say my floors are very clean: While I liked that the Sienna didn't damage my floor, I can't say it actually did a great job removing dirt from the vinyl flooring.  The Sienna did a fairly good job cleaning the tile in my home.  I can remove more dirt from the vinyl floor by scrubbing the floor manually or using myHoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-9002)The machine is not of great quality:  Nearly all components, save the cloth mop head, are made of plastic.  Some components, like the water compartment, are made of a fairly brittle plastic.3)The cloth mop head does not glide across hard surfaces:  I'm not impressed with the maneuverability of the product.  On vinyl flooring, the cloth mop head did not want to glide.  It was like pushing something through mud.  The (hot) cloth mop head would fall off and I would have to reattach it. It was a lot of effort to work with this machine when the machine was supposed to make the cleaning task easier to complete.4)The carpet glider - I don't get it:  The Sienna comes with a plastic triangular piece that fits over the mop head.  It is called the carpet glider and is supposed to enable the user to use the Sienna on carpets.  When you affix the plastic piece (meaning set the Sienna on top of the carpet glider - it doesn't attach in any semi-permanent sort of way), the Sienna will glide quite well but the steaming of a carpet only really makes it wet.  If your child or pet vomits, don't expect this unit to lift a stain.  It may sanitize the floor, but you will still need a carpet cleaner to truly clean the carpet.5)The cord:  The machine has a cord wrap, which is nice.  However, there is no clamp on the machine's plug.  This means that unless you entwine the plug really well in the wrapped up cord, you will have a cord that is unraveling all over the place.Final opinion:  For my house, I don't know if the Sienna merits frequent use.  I don't intend to use it on carpets and it doesn't do a great job cleaning vinyl, but it did work well on tile.  I prefer a machine that has more all around utility.  When I don't feel like hand scrubbing, I use myHoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900, which can be used on carpet and hard floors like tile and vinyl.This product is made in China.",3.0,"at the very least, you'll get some exercise pushing this burro across the floor",1321747200,"11 20, 2011"

I was tired of drinking out of mugs made in China and wondering if it was safe and just decided it wasn't worth the risk.These can be used for hot or cold drinks but since they are just plain old glass (as near as I can tell and they aren't advertised as anything more), they can crack with hot drinks. But I've never had it happen. It just worries me that it might.They appear attractive from a distance or at a casual glance but most of them have minor flaws that are quite apparent if you look closely at all. These have seams and the seams are unsightly.

But -- I don't think it turned out any better then a batch of ice cream produced by my $33 ice cream maker. Or my parents' $60 ice cream maker.For a first use, or the first use of the season, it is recommended that you fill the bucket half full of water and let it sit for an hour so that the wood can soak up the water and expand, therefore creating a better seal for the machine. Not really a big deal, but then, neither of the other two machines need this. Assembly was pretty standard and not too difficult. But once you turn it on - loud! My cheap ice cream maker was quieter. The ice cream was done in less then 30 minutes, as promised. But then you remove the stirring paddle and spend 5 minutes trying to rescue about a third of your ice cream from its grasp. It has two wooden attachments on the side, then little evil bars with hoops on the end throughout the center (sorry, bad description, just know it is a pain to remove ice cream from).So none of these complaints are actually that serious -- it's noisy and the paddle soaks up ice cream, I could adapt. But for $270?! When I first got this, I thought ""Whoa! A $200 ice cream maker, that's gotta do something cool!"", but not really. It is large. That is about the only thing that is different then my other machines. But the appeal of homemade ice cream is eating it fresh, and I don't ever have enough people to make that much ice cream! When I used this, I only made 4 quarts; that fed 5 people, and there was still enough left over for one or two more servings. If you really need to make that much ice cream, buy two of the cheaper 4-quart makers and make two batches.The only real positive thing I can say, is that the recipe booklet that came with the maker had a good recipe for mint ice cream (though leave out the last tsp of extract). If this were a $50 maker I'd have no problem recommending it. But at $270 I can't think of anything that justifies that price. If you want a good ice cream maker, I recommend these:Hamilton Beach 68330R 4-Quart Automatic Ice-Cream MakerorCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker.

I was excited about the potential for a large quick heating aluminum pan with short handles.  It can be used as a substitute for a number of pans, but it performs none of those tasks superbly.  Using this pan for various purposes, I struggled to find its true niche in life.  I tried it as a fry pan, a stir-fry pan, and a casserole dish.  It is a jack of all trades and a master of none.

An aluminum pan performs very differently from a multi-clad stainless steel pan.  I confess to have a preference for multi-clad stainless steel.  I have a variety of pans from different manufacturers in my collection.  I have Cuisinart Multi-Clad, All-Clad, Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless Steel, and Calphalon Commercial.

So I value a quality set of cookware to be durable, easy to clean and that performs well.  My mother had a Farberware cookware set that I believe she got as a wedding present in the late 50s.  While the handles look the same still, this new set has nothing else in common.  The old set was all stainless steel with no Teflon coating, and is still in use today.So, that said, this is not a set for me, and let me give a few reasons why:1) The set is made from cast aluminum with no extra material on the bottoms.  The aluminum heats up quickly but unevenly, especially if you are using a gas stove.  It's easy to burn things with this cookware.2) The porcelain enamel exterior is easier to clean (with a non-abrasive cleaner), but should not be used on a glass cooktop.  To quote from another web site: ""Please also note that cookware with a painted, porcelain enamel or colored exterior must never be overheated on a glass/ceramic stovetop. Cookware of this type that is overheated may, in some instances, fuse to the surface of the stovetop requiring complete replacement of the stovetop.""3) Teflon really is not needed on pots as much as it is on frying pans.  Teflon can release harmful vapors if overheated, and also reduces the production of 'fond' when sauteing that enhances flavor in some recipes.  Teflon will also eventually come loose from the surface if used heavily.I will say that this set does have a market though.  I think the criteria would be that you have an electric stove with traditional electric burners, that you are on a tight budget and cannot afford higher quality cookware, and that you tend to use cookware to mostly heat up or combine and warm ingredients on the stove.  If that is you, then I think this cookware will serve you well.  However, if you are a 'serious' cook, then I would skip this set altogether and consider saving your money for a better quality set.Personally, I have Wolfgang Puck's Cafe Collection cookware, which is heavy gauge stainless steel and I like it.  This set would work fine if you have a induction, glass or ceramic cooktop, where you would want Stainless Steel cookware that is made with the full cap base.  You could also check out theCuisinart MCP-12N MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Setfor stainless, or a hard-anodized set like theAnolon Advanced Bronze Hard Anodized Nonstick 11-Piece Cookware Set, or a ceramic-lined set like theWearEver C944S564 Pure Living Nonstick Scratch Resistant Ceramic Coating PTFE-Free and PFOA-Free Dishwasher Safe 5-Piece Cookware Set, Champagne Goldif you like non-stick but not Teflon.",3.0,It's a decent beginner or light-use set,1353888000,"11 26, 2012"

When I got to a piece of new carpet with lots of lint, the light came on indicating a jam ... and when I emptied the dust cup, I noticed the filter was totally jammed with lint, and it's not a quick or easy task to clean it.  I finally settled on a letter opener for prying the lint out of the filter grooves.  I had to clean the filter three more times, but completed all the floors and they looked great.I had most of the same problems as everyone else: the hose kept popping loose from its storage position, the powerful front exhaust blew dust and lint away before the vacuum could get to it, and the hose is short and there's no extension.  Mine hasn't stopped from over-heating yet, but I won't be surprised if it does.After one day of use, I plan to keep it and its problems.",3.0,Great Suction ... with some Problems!,1162598400,"11 4, 2006"
A39LRLKACX89IP,B00KSRV3UQ,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[0, 2]","As a long time coffee hater, I might be a good pick to review this kind of thing.  This is the second French coffee press I've gotten from the Vine.  The first was glass and it broke in the brewing process, maybe because I used boiling water instead of just hot, but I would have thought something that was meant to heat up like that would expand without breaking.  Strangely, a double walled glass tea cup with silicon brew cap also broke when adding boiling water, it was another Vine product. The good news here this is not glass, the bad news they failed at one of the most important parts.  That part is the press itself, specifically the seal!Before I return to that more about coffee hating.  I tried coffee as a kid and found it bitter and without substance.  I was even more confused when I found people drinking decaf, as the only benefit I saw from coffee was the caffeine.  How did I become a drinker, part experimentation and part education I guess.  When I was young, diners and donut shops dominated the Midwest, morning coffee was a big thing, but at that time no one knew from Starbucks or the Coffee Hut.  You drank coffee black, with milk or cream and maybe a bit of sugar, there were not the exotic creamers and flavorings of today.  My limited exposure to coffee was to brew a pot and put 3 ounces of milk six teaspoons of sugar in a cup and 5 ounces of coffee, mostly to get the caffeine.  I used it to stay up and study and though the taste was tolerable, it didn't make me crave it.The late 70s and early 1980s come along and those square cans of International Coffees hit the market and Mocha, and Vanilla coffee started a bit of a flavor revolution.  They were instants, but I liked them better and didn't have to go to the trouble of brewing.  The taste was more mellow and I realized what I didn't like about coffee was the bitter taste.  I worked in Houston at the time and although not quite New York, it was a fairly cosmopolitan city, especially compared to my home town in Indiana.  They had some coffee houses downtown, in quiet clubs that favored Jazz, chess, and activities. They also had really good coffee, some of them had an Italian contraption that could make Espresso, Cappuccino, and Lattes.  Did not know what those were, but I was educated by the maker and tried them.  Did not like Espresso, too strong for a non-coffee lover.  Cappuccino and Latte's are pretty much the same to me in taste, and I liked both, but where did the bitters go?It was explained to me by the professional staff of one of these coffee houses, (I've long forgotten the name), that bitterness is only a problem when the coffee is harshly boiled out of the grounds, and the ground is wrong, as it is for a lot of canned coffees.  The best, but mostly non-practical way to make great coffee if you have the right equipment, is to receive shipments of Arabica beans (usually the best although not that much more expensive than the alternative), then grind them daily with a radial grinder as needed, and keep the remainder refrigerated for not more than a week.  If you're a shop with good connections that might work, but few are.  I'd like to think the modern Starbucks gets beans fresh picked every week, but we all know they don't, and it's not like it degrades badly, it's just not in the realm of fantastic.  Since people mostly don't know what they are missing, having grown up with bad coffee anyway, a little better seems really nice.  Why else would you fork over 4 dollars for what you paid 10 cents for in the Late 70's and with free refills to boot!Back to the product here, the French press.  I guess the theory is instead of pouring water over the grounds, we let them brew in the water and then press the coffee though the filter sort of in reverse.  The instructions say use a coarse ground, and that's definitely true because you make the problem I had worse.  I might have been OK if I'd let everything settle and kept this on the table, but I picked it up before I used the plunger.  I got grounds in my first cut which are nasty to drink.  I examined the plunger and the seal.  The seal has a fine mesh, and an outer spring to push with some tension.  Unfortunately the mesh was bent in a few places and I could see gaps on the side walls of the pot.  The gaps were big enough to let grounds through.  The producer of this failed at the most critical part.  Still, I wanted to see the taste so I poured the coffee through a fine mesh strainer and added creamers and sugar.  It was very good coffee, much better than the BUN machine at work makes even when it's fresh, it's too bad I have to double filter it. They either need a better sealing mechanism or stricter quality control on the mesh.  At least it worked and didn't break like the glass one.Bottom Line a no recommend, decent coffee, but does not always work as advertised.  Maybe the reviews on the Zon will reveal a model that creates a better seal, but if I'd paid money for this, I would have sent it back.  I'm still going to use the mini brewer that I paid two dollars at a yard sale for.  It works and the coffee is not bad.  You'd think as long as they've been making French presses, they'd have them perfected by now!",3.0,"If this was selling at list price, my review drops another star.",1405728000,"07 19, 2014"

This took about 10 to 15 minutes with a screwdriver to attach the handle and a few parts that needed to be snapped into place.It is very lightweight and constructed mainly of plastic. While this is good for hauling up and down the stairs, the machine has a flimsy feeling when operating it. Even though lightweight, it's powerful and does a nice job picking up dirt and hair.The dirt canister is easy to remove, empty and replace. It's size is small but this is comparable to other bagless vacuums I've owned. For homes with a mix of carpet and bare floors like mine, the height adjustment feature is great and easy to change on the fly. It also does a nice job cleaning throw rugs without chewing them up. There are five height levels to choose from and this is my favorite feature. There is also a light on the front and it's bright enough to let you see what you are cleaning in those dark corners.A couple of negatives, for me: The onboard attachments fall off the machine, it has a bulky feel to it and is a little bit too loud. The furniture attachments do a good job of cleaning but are a pain to hook up and then put the hose back on the machine. The on/off switch is a foot pedal at the bottom but because of the light weight of the vacuum, stepping on the switch causes it to tip.

We pre-heat the bed on high, then turn the controller on low or sometimes medium, which we find to be more than comfortable.  There are three heat settings and no auto-shut off.  We agree with the reviewer who said, ""The control to change the temperature and turn the unit off has blindingly bright lights that make my whole bedroom bright. Pushing the button successively (there is no dial) to make the unit turn off or change heat setting is VERY noisy, waking up my spouse. The control also doesn't have a flat bottom, so it won't rest in a reasonable position on the side table. The bottom is rounded for some unknown reason.  Finally, the place where the cord plugs into the warmer itself is a HUGE lump that is right in the middle of the (bottom edge of the) warmer, exactly where my feet constantly hit it.""  We find these things to be somewhat annoying, but have not found any other similar product.  The picture online is wrong and the description is vague.  This is a rectangular pad with rounded corners, which is 45 X 24"" in the twin/full size.  It just lies on top of the bed.  We put ours under the mattress pad and sheet.  The heating wires do not extend right to the edge; instead they stop about 2-3 inches, all around, from the edge.  I'm not sure how you would use this on a twin bed, as the instructions state to NOT bend the pad/wires and a twin bed is only 39"" wide.  It would work well for a full-sized bed.  We use one on a queen-sized, as the queen version was unavailable.  The one other problem we have had is that one of the pads was heating very unevenly.  Almost nothing on one side, much more on the other.  For that reason and the fact that it doesn't really fit a twin-sized bed, we returned it.

A3KR2X4CYMP1Q1,B001NGO28Q,Win231,"[0, 0]","I just picked this grinder up today.  I've been looking at various burr grinders on the web for the past few days & I just happened to be at ""Fry's Electronics"" & saw this one.  I've been using my other Cuisinart flat burr grinder for six years & found it to be reliable.  The burrs were understandably dull & the grinds container was chipped due to my pounding it on the counter to get the coffee unstuck from the sides of the plastic, but it still works, so it must have a durable motor.  I'll just keep it as a spare.  I won't be pounding the grinds container on this one.  While handling the display model in the store, I was impressed with the burrs & the design.  The burrs looked like heavy-duty stainless steel & there is a steel handle that swivels up, allowing the top burrs to be simply lifted out as a complete assembly; no screws, nothing complicated.I was surprised at how quickly the beans were ground on the ""Drip Coffee"" setting.  I was concerned about heat, but the ground coffee wasn't even warm.  On this model, the ground coffee falls straight down into the bin from a hole on the top, unlike my other Cuisinart flat-burr grinder which has a chute & the coffee enters the bin from the rear.  I suppose this design will reduce the amount of coffee jamming the unit, which sometimes occurred with my other grinder.  Some reviewers mentioned their expensive burr grinders having trouble & jamming with ""oily"" coffee beans.  The first batch of beans I fed into this grinder were very oily & shiny ""Willoughby's French Roast"" beans that came with my Technivorm coffeemaker.  I've never seen coffee beans that look like these; they're so shiny that it looks like someone lacquered each bean - with two coats.  The grinder had absolutely NO trouble with these.  There is a useful feature I later noticed while grinding beans without the lid on the hopper.  The center post is much larger than on previous models.  The post effectively traps the beans in the hopper at the end of the grind, preventing them from jumping out.I'm not impressed with the digital display; I unplug all my small electrical appliances after use anyway.  I also don't care for the automatic ""Set-it-for-the-number-of-cups"" feature.  I simply prefer ""Start"" & ""Stop.""  All I wanted was a decent quality burr grinder for around $100.00 & it looks like I got it.  As for durability, time will tell & I'll update.The static produced by this grinder is the only serious gripe I have.  Initially, I thought it was because of the plastic ground-coffee bin, but there is no static when using my older Cuisinart flat-burr grinder which also has a plastic bin.  I think the static is caused by the grinding method - conical burr as on this unit instead of the flat burr as on my old unit.  Or, perhaps it's the grinder material - ceramic on the old unit as opposed to stainless steel on the new unit.",3.0,"Works Well, But Lots of Static",1365292800,"04 7, 2013"

I am very pleased with the performance on my carpeted stairs too. Powerful, and so very convenient, and it detaches to be a hand-held with the brush moving. Vacuum the bed, couch, vehicles.... Turn off the brush for hardwood floors. I am very thorough when it comes to vacuuming, but at the same time very lazy. I just don't wanna lug out the full size vac, plug it in here, adjust the cord there, break out the attachments..etc. Now I just pick up my Eureka and spot-vac on the fly. I took my old full size and put it in the basement. Easy to dump out the canister; just give the filter a wipe with a damp paper towel and you're good to go. Only thing I wish was that the charger told you when it was done charging, as I like to charge my cordless appliances to capacity before each use. However, I do not believe that it uses a ""memory"" type battery, so it should be OK. I have only had it a week and probably gave it a total of a half hour's work, but other cordless handhelds I have owned were already conking out powerwise, and this one is still going strong. I am going to get another one for my 1st floor...and for the price...can't beat it.Update 10/29/2012I did buy another for my 1st floor, and it works just the same. The first one I bought though seems to have some battery issues, and that started a few months ago. Just off the charger it's rip roarin' and ready to go. For at lest ten minutes it's running at full power- no noticeable power loss. However, let it sit off the charger a full day and it is now noticeably weaker- if not almost dead, 24 hours after last use. I went from a seemingly full charge, to an 90% dead battery in 24-36 hours, without using it. I have tried different charging times 8 hours to 24 hours, tried taking the battery out of the unit and leaving it on the side........no difference. Seems like a defective or worn down battery, and at $22 a pop for the battery....... Bottom line, if you get this problem, put it on the charger every night. It's not really a big deal, just MY thing that I don't like to leave things on chargers all the time. The second unit I bought for the 1st floor hasn't had this problem. The charge level is always just about where it was the last time I used it.Another complaint is the dust cup bag gets pretty dirty after awhile, and if you don't take it out and clean it good in the sink, then you are gonna lose some suction. I reduced my rating to 4 stars, but I am a nitpicker.......I still highly recommend this product.Update 2/28/2013The batteries now on both quite literally suck. Though the first one sucks worse. Spends most of it's time on the charger and will only give you a few minutes of run time before becoming weak and useless. I can charge it all night and take it off the charger- flip it on- full power. Turn it off immediately and come back to it 5 hours later and it's half dead or worse- and I HAVE experimented with charging times, etc. It is GREAT for what I bought it for- the hard tile lint removal in the bathroom and bits of fuzz etc in the bedroom, and it's light and just awesome.... But the battery issue......Kinda kills the whole convenience deal if I have to keep putting it back on the charger! Reduced it to a 3 star rating for this.

This is especially so with narrow-bore or older drains.This simple but brilliant OXO `good grips' device is very well thought out. It's big enough to cover the entire drain aperture of almost any shower and has a rubber seal-ring around its circumference which performs two functions: it stays where it is and cannot be easily dislodged from the drain aperture by water pressure from the shower head, or by your feet, and it prevents the ingress of hair or any other matter under the edge. It has small drain-holes (it actually looks like a shower-head) rather than a mesh so is very effective at catching everything.A minority of reviewers here report that it did not work well for them, with their particular shower drains. It's probably a good idea to consider their experiences too prior to purchase; it seems in most of these reported cases the surface containing the drain aperture was not flat, and therefore because this OXO device is larger than most in diameter, it won't work with a curved tub.

ABW5L9SY1OYX4,B0000YTYGM,Bob D,"[0, 0]","I just purchased my 5th of these machines, so I obviously must like them.  I am a coffee snob and only drink dark roast coffee from places like Starbucks.  From those on the East Coast, I can't stand Dunkin Donuts.  Bottom line, I like coffee and I like it a certain way.  Well...I have owned many different coffee makers in the past and this is the only product that I have even considered since the first one I have owned - the coffee is that good.  And...I don't buy expensive beans or grind them just before brewing - I can buy Eight O'Clock or some other decent quality ground beans from my local supermarket as long as it is medium to dark roast and I can make a great cup of coffee with this machine - I just vary the amount of coffee a bit depending on the grind and strength.  For those like me - try Pacific Rim from Whole Foods - great and inexpensive.So...why not 5 stars?  Simple, the longevity of these machines aren't that great.  I lost one machine to a leak.  Another just died. Can't remember what happened to the previous ones, but they typically last a few years.  Given that we make 8-10 cups most every day and sometimes another pot later in the day, the machines have certainly paid for themselves.The other issue is that unless you are careful, you can end up with coffee and water all over the place and if you end up doing that a couple of times with the same machine, you can shorten it's life expectency a bit (I think the shortest one of mine ever lasted was 2+ years, so not bad for electronics).  The issue is simple - the basket has to click into position and the carafe (which by the way can keep coffee hot for a really long time - probably 4-6 hours wouldn't be all that unusual - sort of depends on how much coffee is in the carafe - the more coffee, the less air, the longer is stays hot).Actually, this purchase I had to send back to Amazon as the basket was defective - it wouldn't snap into place.  Amazon was fantastic - sent a new one out next day air and sent me a slip to return the old one at their expense.  The new one is great.I have told anyone who asks - this is the only one to buy.  Also, don't know this for sure, but a manager at home goods store where we bought one of these many years ago advised against buying one that grinds and brews as once the grinder goes, you need a new machine.  I like the simplicitly that this one has AND love that I can program it at night to make coffee in the morning.One last thing - if you decide against the Cuisinart, do your self a favor and only buy a machine with a thermal carafe.  First, you don't bake the coffee which means it will still taste decent 15 minutes after the first pot.  Ever had coffee that was made an hour or more ago after it has been sitting on a warming element - yikes - I think I would rather drink the stuff from my local diner!!

I didn't use the recommended baking sheet but just sprinkle flour on the bottom of the pan. Despite the raise product label, the loaf just fell out of the pan. I have bake bread in CorningWare meat loaf pans that have sides that flare out towards the top and the bread still stick to its edges even when I sprayed oil all over the inside before I put the dough in. With this pan, I sprinkle dry flour on the pan's bottom before I drop the dough in After I poured the baked bread out, all I need to do to clean it was to wipe the bottom of the pan with a dry dish cloth.

It is also very safe to use among small kitchen appliances, as you would have to have the lid fully closed to operate the blade. We use it every morning for coffee, and it does a good job grinding coffee beans into fine ground.It is not very easy to clean comparing to a food processor, because the base, where the coffee beans go into, cannot be rinsed under water. The instruction suggests to wipe it clean with dampen cloth. Since I could not figure out how to detach the blade from the base (the manual also does not indicate how, so it is probably not possible), I have to use a paint brush to sweep the inside. It is not a problem for us since we only use it for coffee beans, but if you also want to use it for herbs and spices, the sweeping can be some work.Speaking of grinding herbs, it is a perk of this device and part of the reason I bought it. But it does not chop the herbs as fine as a food processor. If you try to mix small amount of herb and olive oil, most of them ended up hanging on the sidewall after it starts, so the mixture cannot be chopped anymore.

A3963R7EPE3A7E,B005BFZ5H2,"John N. Schar ""cxxi121""","[15, 16]","This is a vacuum cleaner for the hearty and demanding.  It is a semi-heavy weight and performs with vigor.  I am a real fan of bagless HEPA filter vacs and this is one of the better ones.This Panasonic cleans a path with almost perfection.  To test it I cleaned the carpeting fully with my then favorite upright.  Then the next day I did the same thing with the Panasonic and to my utter surprise I picked up even more ground in dirt.  Mind you, it was not the heavy stuff we bring in from the outdoors but just daily dust and dog hairs.  The volume in the Panasonic was considerably less than the first go but its presence suggested to me a better job at getting as much dirt as possible on each pass.  The most important factor in a vac's cleaning is its cleaning.  All else is either an add on or subtraction.  Cleaning the carpet is a full 5 without equivocation.  The pet hair brush is a nice addition and is particularly useful in cleaning pet hairs from furniture.  While most handles are not a big deal this handle has one that does NOT cause anger because of its design.  It fits the hand perfectly and does not scratch nor create distractions.I downgraded it one full point for the following reasons:1. It is a heavy little upright and with its wheels will not glide on the floors with ease.  Larger and wider rear wheels might make the moving easier.2.  The tilt switch used in dropping the handle to a working position is somewhat small and big fat feet sometimes do not work as perfectly as the designer thought.3.  The on/off switch is too small and seems to be a potential breaking point sooner than it should.  I may be wrong there but it is difficult sometimes to turn the machine on and off.4.  Dirt accumulates in a ball that has a propensity to reduce the vac's cleaning ability.  Also, that little ball gets difficult to empty when the bottom of the vac is opened.  I do not care about reaching up there to pick out the dirt but it is not intended to operate that way.  Maybe there are too many Yorky hairs in the mix.5.  I like having a cord winder but be careful.  I got it going on the first go and it whipped me like a little puppy.  I sure am glad it hit me and not the grandfather's clock.  After a few uses I have the knack now.6. The little slot that holds the cord out of the way on the back of the handle is almost useless.  It is about 1/32"" too big and the cord will not stay put.  How's that for being anal?7.  The hose is barely long enough to reach the top of a sofa much less the top of curtains.  While it is quite strong and a tad heavy it is just too short.  The brush attached to the end of the hose is handy for those of us who misplace our brushes but it does not come off.I honestly enjoy using the Panasonic and will for sometime.  While the cord is somewhat short it is O.K. and the hose could be longer but I use a handheld mostly to do above the head cleaning.  The brushes on the roller are good and stiff which makes cleaning so much better and more through.  I did not mention the swivel action of the head because I am not quite sure if I like it or not.  It is a tad hard to get used to after so many years of not having that feature.",4.0,"Move on, I'm Really Good",1329177600,"02 14, 2012"

A2GHU8I0P3HFRW,B0051T8Y1W,"Wandrwoman ""Wise as Aphrodite, Beautiful as A...","[212, 217]","This is not a bad hand-held steamer, it really isn't.  It's just that its reservoir is  small. It only holds 6 oz. of water which gives a maximum of eight to 15 minutes of steam...if you're lucky.  The thing about steam cleaning is that once you get going, you are always going to find something else to clean. The last thing you want when you have wedged yourself upside down between your bathroom sink and toilet, so that you can get to that really nasty square inch of grout, is to run out of steam.Although steam cleaning can be kind of fun, it does take elbow grease and energy. The spurts of steam loosen the gunk and dirt and then something has to wipe it away and dry the area cleaned. Sometimes a brush is needed to scrub at the dirt or stain. The real point of steam cleaning (other than sanitizing) is that soaps and detergents are not totally necessary, at least in most normal situations.Professional steamers combine cleaning products along with the steam. Household steamers, however, work only with water. In fact you are asked to only use distilled water to fill this steamer's tank. This is fine except sometimes you need something more. A little squirt of say,Natures Miracle Hard Floor Stain and Odor Remover Trigger Spray, along with an application of steam cleans stubborn dirt better and faster. This is good to keep in mind when the steamer will only go for about eight minutes; you don't want to spend half of the time working on a single difficult spot.A month or so ago I purchased a steam mop, theEureka Enviro Hard-Surface Floor Steamer,313A. This is very good for kitchen and bathroom floors, but if you want to get into tight areas such as behind the sink or clean the grout in the shower stall, you need a hand-held steamer such as this one.Things to know about this steamer:1) The instruction book is well written (in English) and illustrated2) Steamfast operates a customer service website and 800 number3) The steamer is easy to hold and not too heavy (6 oz of water is not too taxing)4) The electric cord is 12.5' long5) The steamer comes with six attachments: a jet nozzle, an extension hose, a large nylon brush, a small nylon brush, a small brass brush, and a measuring cup6) The measuring cup is innovative due to a long enclosed pouring spout that eliminates the need for a funnel.7) Of the six attachments, only the jet nozzle and the measuring cup are necessary8) There is no on/off switch9) There is an ""on"" light which goes off when the steam reaches the required temperature10) The steamer should not be tilted more than 45 degrees during use. If you do, hot water and not steam will come out.11) It takes 3 minutes for the steam to heat up12) It takes about 10 minutes for the device to cool down enough so that it can be refilled13) There is a 1 year limited warranty14) Steam is very hot. You have to watch your fingers and toes. Duh!I tried all the attachments that come with this steamer. The small nylon brush became deformed after a few minutes of use. I have included a picture of the sorry thing. The extension hose is too long a delivery system for the steam which dissipates before it emerges from the end. The brass brush stood up to the heat (unlike the nylon one) but it is meant to clean grills or other items that can take the scratching.The most effective technique, I discovered is to hold the steamer in one hand and a towel or a scrub brush in the other and alternate between the two: blast of steam.....wipe or scrub.....blast of steam.....wipe or scrub, being ever careful of one's fingers.What is wanted is strong shots of ""dry"" steam that will sanitize and dissolve dirt but will not leave the area very wet. The steam should be able to evaporate quickly. There should not be pools of water anywhere.This is a nice steamer, capable of delivering powerful shots of steam. I just wish the reservoir were bigger.NOTE: 3/30/2012 Since writing the above review, I have come to better appreciate this steamer. I have used it to remove old wallpaper from the walls of a closet, remove sticky adhesive from a door, and (carefully) steam set a head full of rollers. While I have been able to clean surfaces just with steam, there are times when I have used the steam along with a cleaning product for a faster and better result.",4.0,A Good Handheld Steamer,1329177600,"02 14, 2012"

Make a quick smoothie for my kid before we head out the door to school because, once again, he turned off his alarm and would prefer to dash out of the house eating a Pop Tart? Not so fast, kid. I can throw some Greek yogurt, a splash of milk, some wheat germ and some applesauce in the blender cup -- which you can drink from if need be -- so step away from the artificially colored, artificially flavored, sugar-laden, fiber-less junk you were hoping for. Mom wins.As far as an immersion blender or as an electric whisk? Eh. I've yet to see one actually do what it claims, which is to substitute for a stand-mixer. The whisk and immersion-blender on the Miallegro work better than my B&D;, but they're not perfect. That's okay: I don't expect them to be. IMHO, you either commit to using your stand-mixer, or you shy away from the extra cleaning that entails in favor of using something convenient like this.All in all: buy it for the mini-processor and -blender functions, at which it excels, and only look to the immersion blender and whisk when you're in such a hurry that you can't do it manually.

AJ7H24LP4YV4H,B001EFMD8W,Mandi,"[1, 1]","I think almost any animal owner can justify spending 500 bucks on a vacuum. I know I can. I don't know what it is about the Dyson Animal Ball that makes it good for pet owners, but I do know that it gets up the hair - and that's where I find my money well spent.I won't go into great detail about why you should buy this vacuum. Instead I'll just explain why I gave it four stars and why I still think it's worth the money. Let's do this with the good 'ol pros and cons list.Pros:It sucks - literally. I did what I like to call ""the dark shirt test"" - after I vacuumed my rug I rolled around on it wearing a dark shirt and checked to see how much dog hair was on me. None. My previous vacuum never passed the dark shirt test.The ball - what a genius idea. It makes the vacuum so much EASIER to maneuver - making it seem like less work to vacuum and *gasp!* fun.It is lighter (emphasis on the -er) than most vacuums.It has a small footprint making it easy to store in a closet and not take up all the floor space (in my closet anyway).Easy to get under low lying furniture.It has a reach wand and a neat little motorized brush attachment for stairs and curtains.Easy carpet to floor switch - no more having to turn off the vacuum and bend over to adjust the level, just press the button and it adjusts itself to go from carpet to hard floor in an instant.It has a warranty - this is my 3rd vacuum purchase in 6 years. It's nice to know that for at least the next 5 I won't have to buy another.Cons:The instruction manual leaves much to be desired. I had to find a youtube video to figure out how to get the wand out.The price - costing as much as a computer the cost is hard to swallow.Not as light as you expect - you will notice this if your house has 2 flights of carpeted stairs like mine.The wand is not as easy to use on the stairs as I thought it would be. The hose really requires some muscle to pull as you get further up the steps.The motorized brush is small and requires several swipes across each step. It also doesn't get into the corners and crevices of the steps where the dog hair likes to congregate. It can be hard to push across the carpet of the steps. If they had an another motorized brush attachment with a wider footprint I'd buy it and use that instead.The cord is short! Well, shorter than the cord on my previous vacuum. My rec room is quite large so I have to unplug and plug this cord back in a couple times to get the whole space vacuum.Overall, I recommend this vacuum if you are the loving owner of a notorious shedder like I am. I found it on sale so I don't regret spending the dough, nor do I think I would even if I had paid full price. However, for a $500+ vacuum it really should come with a better manual, longer cord, and better stair vacuuming tool.

A3CRAOYAUEAFMG,B0000AXDY9,Brett,"[0, 0]","Overall I'm happy with this product.  The hopper part where you load all the cans is made from relatively light weight plastic and I wish it was a little sturdier.  Mine broke after about a day of use.  To be fair though I also crushed 12 large garbage bags of cans over the course of 2 days so under normal use it would probably have lasted longer.I am slightly disappointed though because the advertisement says you can crush 10 cans in 10 seconds.  I found that the hopper only holds 9 cans (you can actually see in the picture there are only 9 cans and the hopper is completely full). If you try to crush quickly, the cans tend to jump around and get stuck in the hopper.  This is how I broke my hopper because a can jumped up and got twisted sideways.  I didn't notice soon enough so when I went to crush the can, the one that had jump up fell on top the plunger which then forced it into the side.  I found that once you get below about 3 or 4 cans they start 'jumping' more.  So, I ended up having a friend stand there and keep dropping cans into the hopper so it never went below about 6 cans.There are instructions in the box that let you know how to get replacement parts.  I haven't decided yet if I want to try to build my own hopper or buy the replacement from the manufacturer.",4.0,Works great for the money,1362182400,"03 2, 2013"
A1BKSBVYX9KDEG,B000V5X826,"D-T-D ""Mister Don""","[3, 3]","I started shopping around for a glass kettle since my old kettle started to rust. For about $10, this Medelco kettle seems like a good candidate.Positive :- All glass. Unlike Stainless Steel kettles, if there is any rusts, you will see it. This is why I chose this kettle.Negative :- The bottom of the kettle is smaller than smallest head on my electric range. This means that significant amount of heat will be loss dissipating around the kettle and range. Comparing to my old kettle, I can feel much more heat around the kettle. At high setting, it takes much longer to boil the water.- With significant amount of heat dissipating around, it means that the lower part of the handle will get hot. I can usually get by by holding the upper part. But in several occasions when I left it on the range too long, it gets too hot and I need a oven mitt to pick it up. -- The lid handle can get too hot sometime too.- You must take off the lid in order to pour water. This could become a problem when you're not too careful when opening the lid. Try not to lift it up since hot steam will hit your hand. Flip it to the side does the trick. No more steam straight into your hand.- The ""whistle"" is not loud at all. Sometime the noise of boiling water is even louder than the whistle. If you just left it on the stove, and not paying attention, you might not hear the whistle at all.- It's a glass, so there's no other way around this drawback. In case you want to boil several batches of water, you have to wait for the kettle to cool down a bit before pouring in cold water. Otherwise, the glass will break.With all negatives, I still think this kettle is worth the price and the fact that I don't have to worry about rusts trumps all the negatives. Sure, it's a different kind of kettle and there's a limitation. But for the price and some adjustments on your part, this is a good kettle.",4.0,"Great, but not perfect.",1288742400,"11 3, 2010"

A1981TU06T4ME4,B003QLT04M,David L. Little,"[31, 31]","I have had no problems with this machine, and most of the other reviewers in the 3-4 star ratings have made some pretty accurate comments.  I question the importance that some other reviewers have made about some aspects of this machine.My negative comments:1. The owners manual is far too complex and poorly written for a relatively simple coffee pot.2. Their advertising lists 5 cups. Nonsense! Nobody drinks out of a 5oz coffee cup anymore. Expect 25oz of brewing capacity.3. The carafe does dribble a little bit down the side if it has a wet exterior and is rather full. If dry and not full to the top...no problems. You do need to avoid excessively fast pouring to remain accurate. Mr. Coffee needs to get their act together and extend the pour spout about another 1/2"" to eliminate the dribbles. This is not a problem if you are at your kitchen counter, but would be a huge problem if your were refilling your someone's cup while they were holding it in their lap.4. The corners of the water-fill area are a bit tedious to fill, but not difficult.5. The clock and digital display is recessed rather deeply into the case. This makes you bend way over and look at it on the level of the cabinet in order to see the ""PM"" sign and all of the numbers. Annoying, but not really a bad feature.6. The button labels could be simpler. They are in english, so why not ""set brew time"" and ""activate delay brew"" instead of ""set brew"" and ""delay brew"", which seem a bit ambiguous to me. Incidentally, the delay brew time CANNOT be set until you select ""off"". The owners manual does not mention this, which might incline an impatient person to pitch it out as defective.My positive comments:1. This is a very quiet machine, and it makes very good coffee. It perks hot enough to be good, not hot enough to qualify as espresso or ""burnt"".2. The filter cup has a neat little valve at the bottom that allows you to quickly remove the carafe and pour a cup, then return it with no leakage. It prevents leakage on the way to the sink or trash can, too. I don't doubt that other reviewers who had problems with water leaking out onto the counter simply didn't understand how to install the carafe under the filter. It's actually quite easy.3. There is a built-in timer that turns off the burner after one hour after the brew. This will prevent ""left on"" accidents.4. I LIKE the pouring accuracy of the carafe, when it is not dribbling down the side. I also prefer a metal carafe, although they will cool off quicker than glass when removed from the burner. This pot will NEVER get broken and need replacing.5. I have not experienced any ""burning"" of coffee. It's WATER, and the carafe does not boil off the coffee when left on the burner. If you pour off nearly all the coffee, then return it to the heat, you should expect it to boil off the coffee and scorch the bottom.6. The filter cup uses standard small filters, available almost everywhere. In fact, it uses the same filters that fit our 20 year old ""Mr. Coffee"" that finally died.7. It is a fairly attractive black & stainless appliance. If you want something that isn't made out of plastic, warm up your wallet and spend a whole lot more.8. This is an ideal machine for single or small servings. It has no problem making a quick 16oz dose of coffee, or just 5 oz if you are crazy enough to make one that small.",4.0,"Good for the money, no real problems. 25 oz maximum pot size",1337472000,"05 20, 2012"

The machine does as it claims and truly does knock out much of the fat/grease from whatever you are deep frying.We haven't used it multiple times, just on Christmas Day repeatedly.  We decided to attempt fried calamari.  OH MY!!!  It was to die for!  Each batch cooked for 4 mins and were crispy as can be.  The batches towards the end came out super crispy, so we would suggest lowering the cooking time as the oil gets hotter.The spin function is great to have and I can't comprehend how we lived without it before this.  The dial for spin function can be set for as little as 1 second to a maximum 2 minutes.  The cooking dial has a maximum degree of 375.  I can't wait to throw more things at this machine.  After spinning for 30 seconds, we did do the towel test to see what the difference is compared to pan frying and there was a miniscule amount of oil drainage.  Truly, sort of miraculous!!  When we used to make fried calamari in a pan, we would use tons of paper towels and it would still soak through and coat the whole bowl.Now onto the bad...* The cooking temperature knob and the spinning knob should have been more clearly marked.* You have to line up the basket so that it could slide back down.  That is very difficult to do because the basket is HOT.  If you don't it will not go back into place.* On one cooking attempt, in order to use the spin function, you must snap the basket up into place.  The snap function wouldn't happen.  Without the basket snapping up into the lid, you will not be able to make use of the spinning function.  Without spinning, this is just another deep fryer.* Small basket size which would only make half a plate of food.  Not enough for this family of 5.  It does batches quickly though!With the negatives, I hope I just received a glitchy machine and it doesn't happen to all.So, you should go for this little unit because it truly seems to make a fried food taste just a little healthier and this machine looks great on my counter next to my stainless steel appliances.

Fortunately, these fine grinds are packed together into a clump at the top, so you can remove it easily if you're careful.

Requires the Honeywell Quietcare Console Humidifier Replacement Filter (E-9), now priced at $25.87 on Amazon. You're supposed to replace that every couple of months. (I can testify that the filter looks like a dog's breakfast if you leave it in longer, even if you're using filtered spring water). You are also supposed to use Pro-Tec PC-1 Humidifier Tank Cleaning Cartridges to prevent microbial buildup. Those are priced at $10.64 a pair on Amazon, and because this humidifier has a double tank, you have to use the entire double package of Pro-Tecs each time you change the filter. And if you use distilled water, you're running through 25-30 gallons a week in winter at $1 a gallon just to keep the humidity at a minimal 30-35%. And don't forget the $10-plus humidity monitor to see how you're doing.  You do the math--at least $300 a year.  If I had cost-ed it out like this before I bought, I would have settled for a smaller unit for just my bedroom. 2) Labor-intensive to maintain, and it's manual labor.  Incredibly, the two reservoirs in this thing DON'T FILL FROM THE TOP. You have to turn the machine off, remove them, turn them over, unscrew the big caps (Lots of luck if some over-muscled  male screwed them on too tight; you have to get another one to unscrew them.) Then you fill each reservoir with its 1.5 gallons via the upturned hole, screw the lid bag on, and turn the reservoir over. You have to heft the whole 1.5-gallon weight without touching it to the carpet, or you'll contaminate the whole machine (see dog's breakfast, above). At 8.32 lbs per gallon, that's more than 12 pounds of water--too much for a handicapped 68-year-old like me. At least it used to be until I built up some muscle.  I still can't lug the distilled water up the 14 steps to my apartment; my handicapped helper does it for me.  Without him--constant tending with PUR pitcher-filtered water.

A29EGA8RIDPUJ1,B001KYJ52E,D. Henderson,"[90, 94]","Please get your coffee and sit though this review, it's a bit long.  So many people and places rate this as the best drip coffee maker because of the ideal brew temperature and brew drip time.  I spent more time on this review because I want to justify the expense of this coffeemaker.  The bottom line is that to get the really best tasting coffee out of this expensive coffee maker, you may have to spend just a bit of time fussing with it.  This includes finding the right amount of coffee to add, using filtered room temperature water, and I found as some people suggest that if you leave the brew basket top off and stir the coffee grinds during brewing (at least for the first minute when the water has filled the basket and the grinds are swimming in water) , you get even better tasting coffee (better flavor extraction).  Also, unless I buy another thermal carafe specifically theThermos Nissan 51 Ounce Stainless Steel Carafe, I should drink all the brewed coffee within the first hour.  The included carafe just does not maintain the coffee at a decent temperature for more than a half hour, especially if you use the brew through lid.  If the thermal carafe is to replace the need for a heating pad to keep the coffee warm, then I am disappointed that the carafe can't keep great brewed coffee hot for very long.Note that the CDT and its original brother the KBT 741 leave  cup of water in the heating chamber after brewing.  If you dry out your Technivorm (pour out any excess water and dry the reservoir) like I do, then you may wish to add a  cup of water to the chamber when brewing to compensate.  Otherwise, it's only your first batch of coffee that may be a bit stronger.The instructions recommend using fresh tap water (I use filtered water from a carbon block system).  This does result in a brew temperature of 195-200F degrees as measured using my Thermapen.  As an experiment, I reused the heated water from the carafe to brew coffee (the water has not yet cooled to room temperature).  Don't do it.  This seems to confuse the Techivorm's heating element's thermostat and the brewing temperature drops to around 180F degrees instead if the 190 to 200F degrees if I start with room temperature water.  And why did I reuse heated water?  Why waste water?  The instructions recommend ""preheating the thermal carafe"", likely so that the temperature of the brewed coffee does not cool below 190F as it fills the thermal carafe.What do I like about the CDT?The coffee brewed from the Technivorm is more palatable so that I do not need to adulterate the coffee with any sweetener or creamer (if you use decent coffee beans).  I don't have a connoisseur's palate but I also like to consider that I don't have a dead one either.  Even when I brewed carafes of coffee using 10 year old Maxwell House coffee (year 2000 stash) I can tell a difference in taste between it from a CDT and my other coffee maker aCuisinart DCC-450BK 4-Cup Coffeemaker with Stainless-Steel Carafe, Black.  The coffee from the Cuisinart is harsher and bitter more likely because of the 170F brew temperature although the brew time is about the same as the CDT (5 minutes).  I wouldn't have believed the taste difference had I not brewed using both coffee makers.  So if I use filtered water (at room temperature) and fresher quality coffee beans I will get better tasting brewed coffee from the Technivorm.The very open reservoir design makes adding water into the reservoir a breeze (no one should make a mess pouring water into the reservoir).The CDT's reservoir`s round shape makes it very easy for me to dry the reservoir with a kitchen towel.  I wasn't sure about the KBT's square shape and keeping it as clean.  The only difference between the CDT and the KBT 741 is the shape of the reservoir (and the added height of the CDT's reservoir to keep the same capacity as the KBT 741).The CDT comes with a 4 foot long three prong power cord.  I don't have any problems plugging in my CDT anywhere in my kitchen.What are my disappointments?The included thermal carafe is my big disappointment.  While I know that the carafe is designed to be poured using a lid (whether the included lid or the optional brew through lid, both which work okay), how difficult would it have been to stamp a small V-shaped spout on the carafe?  It would help me pour my coffee into myThermos Nissan 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Bottlewithout spilling hot (and precious) coffee down the side of the thermos (yeah, I did have the carafe's top in place).  After I brew my coffee and screw on the top onto the thermal carafe, the outside of the thermal carafe is about ten degrees warmer than my kitchen counter: this carafe is loosing too much heat!  The 198-200F degree coffee drops about 25 degrees after an hour with the regular lid or 10F loss per half hour with the brew through lid.  Oh, and this is where I preheat the carafe with hot water!  The carafe just looses too much heat.  Maybe Technivorm could have Thermos Nissan make their thermal carafes?  I have a travel size Thermos Nissan that I use for nursing my coffee at work.  Even up to eight hours after brewing I still enjoy my coffee's hot to warm temperature (without preheating)!  The Technivorm carafe has no information on where it is made.UPDATE:  March 8, 2010:  I contacted the seller complaining about my carafe's inability to keep the coffee hot.  I was sent a replacement carafe under warranty (no charge).  BIG DIFFERENCE.  The carafe looses about only six to seven degrees per hour instead of the 25 with my original carafe (with the regular lid) and about 12F when using the brew thru lid.  So my coffee is still hot for at least four hours after brewing.  So make sure your carafe is not defective by testing it.  The box the replacement carafe came in says it's made in ""Amerongen-Holland"".PROS:The coffee brewed from the Technivorm is more palatable so that I do not need to adulterate the coffee with any sweetener or creamer (assuming you use decent coffee beans) and filtered water.The large reservoir opening is easy to add water without spilling and also make it easy to dry with a kitchen towel.It comes with a 4 foot power cord so you should be able to plug your CDT nearly anywhere in your kitchen.Bottom line.  Yes, I will keep it.  Even with its faults', the Technivorm still makes it easy to make a great tasting cup of coffee, especially if you drink your coffee black (I've become a black coffee convert).CONS:The CDT (and KBT 741) leaves  cup of water in the heating chamber.  You may wish to add a  cup of water to compensate if you empty and dry out your Technivorm after each use.For the cost, it needs to come with a better thermal carafe that can keep coffee hot for a longer time (make sure you test yours: it should only lose about 6-7F an hour with the regular lid.  And can Technivorm at least stamp a pouring beak on the carafe for even easier pouring, especially when pouring into a travel thermos?",4.0,"Okay, so the brew temperature and time are ideal; but is it worth the expense?",1266710400,"02 21, 2010"

So I was very happy to have a chance to review this through the vine program, it was like getting an old friend back.Since I do not have stairs, I am not frustrated by not having the attachments. But I do miss them for furniture cleaning. This is a basic model, so if these are important to you, I recommend that you find another cleaner.There are three settings on this, power, gentle and spill pickup. Since there are no attachments, you can use spill pickup for any action where you do not need the scrubbers. Other than that, it is a matter of fill, clean, and empty.Good points: VERY EASY assembly! Two screws/bolts, two nuts, and you are done. They simply go straight through the handle! I had one slight problem, when the second screw wouldn't go through, and I realized there was a tiny piece pf plastic in the hole. I used the screwdriver to poke it through, and a few seconds later I was done.I love having the top/bottom, with the top for the clean water and the bottom for the grey water.Finally, my last Hoover was very long-lasting, so I am looking forward to this one being just as sturdy.On the down sideFirst of all, the instructions included are for two different models of the spin scrub, and are very confusing when you can't find the part they are discussing, or when they discuss the scrub settings and yours are completely different from the instructions.This model comes with a piece of cardboard inside of the nozzle. It is not obvious, since it is the same color as the vac, and the start up instructions don't mention it. My first realization that it even existed was after I had been using it when the soggy cardboard showed up in my tank! The remaining portion of the cardboard is still in my nozzle. I have been able to remove some of it using the flat tool called ""nozzle cleaner,"" but the rest will have to work its way out.FYI, if you see a flat piece of funny looking plastic, don't throw it away, look at it closely. It is the Nozzle Clean Out Tool and let's you clean out the nozzle on the top of the vac. It got part of the cardboard out, but it is awkward to use.Finally, the top tank of this one is tighter than my old one, and you really have to push hard to pop it in.I am glad to have an ""old friend"" back, but wish my first experience with it had gone better so that I could give it five stars.The machine comes with a 16 oz bottle ofHoover Deep Cleansing Detergent, 48 Ounces, AH30110, but having used it before, I preferHoover OXY Detergent, 48 Ounces, AH30140.

It doesn't eliminate the effort required, but it certainly reduces it.The unit comes with a small water pitcher for filling the tank, a nozzle tip to attach directly to the unit or hose, a extension hose and a few accessories - a small 'mop head' with a washable microfiber pad, three brushes and a squeegee to tackle different jobs. The bright blue small round rubber brush shown in the product pictures is actually not included. Instead you get a grey stiff bristled brush of identical size. You also get a mesh bag capable of holding the hose and all the accessories when not in use.I tackled my ceramic top stove, hood, and kitchen countertops with this thing. It did a great job of loosening candle wax, honey, and other basic grime from crevices, but what I really wanted was to break up and remove old grease from the hood and stove controls that had resisted several cleaning efforts. It was not a magic bullet, but after a few passes I was able to wipe away hard set grime that had been driving me nuts.  I also took it up against the interior of the microwave that eventually picks up splatter, even when you are careful. It worked great here too, but I still take the rotating plate inside and just soak it on hot water - much simpler.The steamer can leave behind a lot of water, so I wiped down with a clean rag after I used it. On hard, smooth surfaces, the squeegee attachment helps, but the high density sponge built into it can only absorb so much, and must be cleaned frequently so you aren't spreading dirt around the surface that you just loosened. You can instead choose to only use it when applied to an already clean surface to sanitize. The steamer does great on dirt, grease, and surfaces that don't scrub well.The tile cleaning attachment which looks like a small mop head is better suited to tile surrounds and tub/shower stalls. If you want to work on floor tile, you'd be at it a while... it's a bit small, and the handle not meant for that kind of cleaning. Better to use an upright floor model for that. Also, steam will do nothing for hard water/lime and rust stains. If you've got those, you'd still need something likeCLRto knock em out.It did a fairly good job cleaning the cat litter area, powering through that clay 'film' that seems to wind up glued to everything over time. And because it uses nothing but water, it left behind no strong cleaner smell that the cat would find offensive.The tank glows red while it's heating up, and blue once its ready. The unit heats up quickly, and stays hot as long as the power switch is on. Even if you are not using it, the unit is very warm to the touch in some areas, so it's best to turn it off if you will be setting it down for extended periods of time. Surfaces are incredibly hot immediately after steaming them, and the steam within a few inches of the tip always hot.The only thing I might wish for is a way to lock the unit in the 'on' position, though I realize it does not for safety reasons. If it could, it would give me the ability to work with both my hands instead of using one to constantly hold the trigger down.I will be using it on the barbeque grill once the weather gets warmer. I used to have to use oven cleaning spray on that, and that stuff is just noxious. I don't think I'll use it in my oven - there is a possibility that steamers can damage oven heating elements, and my oven has a built in cleaning cycle that works very well (if a bit smelly while it incinerates grime).",4.0,I'm steamed...but in a good way,1361836800,"02 26, 2013"

I do wish the Black & Decker cleaning head/pad flipped (like the Shark), so I could use both sides of the pad to clean (and change/wash the pads less frequently).  I ended up buying four additional pads, so I always have clean pads on hand.  It also seems like I am filling the water tank more.  The cord could be longer, but is the same length as the shark.  The steam is hot (but certainly not sanitizing hot).  In fairness, though, I have not found a steamer that produces sanitizing-level hot steam.  To compensate for this, I spray vinegar directly on the floor and then mop it up.  (NOTE:  Do not ever put anything other than water in the water tank, as you will ruin the mop.)

For those, I need to divide the dough into 2 ounce pieces, so I'd been investigating digital scales.  This one looks even better than the one I was seriously considering.Here's my take on the Soehnle 67080 Page Profi Kitchen Scale:PROS:1.  I love the thin profile of this scale.  It allows me to tuck this scale away in a cabinet on its edge, so I don't valuable cabinet space.  My last scale took half a shelf, so I'm very grateful to find a scale that doesn't eat space.2.  Construction seems to be very sturdy, and the glass surface means easy, quick cleaning - important when I'm measuring sticky dough.3.  Accurate measurement counts when you're baking, and the accuracy of this scale is amazing.  It measures things as small as a single gram.  In case, you don't need the weight in grams, you can push a button on the back of the scale to change to pounds - nice!4.  I also use this scale for measuring yarns.  Say what?  Here's the thing.  When you spin your own yarn, you can divide the hanks you spin into even amounts, and weight is important when estimating how much yarn you'll need for a given product.I'm sure that other users will find other unusual ways to use this very helpful scale.  And those who cook using European recipes will find it easy to meet the requirements of, for example, 300 grams of flour or some weight of eggs.  Now I can use those recipes that were previously off-limits due to my lack of accurate weighting in grams.  Nice!5.  Two AAA batteries (included) power this scale.  Instructions indicate that the scale will read ""lo"", indicating the need for fresh batteries.CONS:Nifty scale with no drawbacks I've discovered, but the instructions are enough to drive me nuts!  How many languages are included?  I count 23.  But the instructions are so terse, they could easily be included on a note for each language to accompany the diagrams which are the real instructions.OVERALL:I'm delighted with my scale and believe any serious cook would be delighted as well.UPDATE:  Febrary 17, 2012KNITTERS and SPINNERS:  I have been successfully measuring grams of carded alpaca fiber in preparation for spinning alpaca yarn.

A2KECWBFMXQLZH,B0014E7CPC,Liz,"[4, 5]","This is by far the best vacuum that I have ever had. It is well worth the price. That being said, it is not as intuitive as it is supposed to be. There are a lot of switches, tabs, buttons, levers, extendable pieces, on/off switches, tubes etc. going on. Usually I can figure out how to work it by trial and error. For example, if I want to use the hose attachment, or the ""Reach Wand,"" I need to push a release button to completely remove the part, flip it around, reattach it facing the correct way, and then add the brush nozzle. It can be a little tricky to get it right, and even after having the vacuum for six months I often still do it wrong on the first try. The instructions are all pictures too, just like Ikea, and just as problematic. There are also stickers all of the vacuum that are supposed to clearly tell you how to use different features, however half the time I find myself just staring that them blankly after I try to do what is pictured and nothing happens. For example, there is a button the release the motorized brush bar at the bottom to remove hair or other items that might wrap around and cause a clog. The button is next to a sticker, showing that the item will release if you do something....I've pressed, pulled, tried to get the button to move side to side...and nothing happens.I also can't figure out a good way to clean stairs with it. The hose is not long enough to safely pull it far enough from the base to reach the stairs, without pulling the entire machine down the stairs with you. I find that it is actually easier to carefully move the entire vacuum down to each individual step. That got tedious so we ended up buying a separate small dirt devil to do the stairs.I also have trouble removing dirt from the canister. The pictures show you simply releasing the canister from the base, pressing a small button, the bottom falls out, and dirt goes into the trash can. Rarely does the dirt, dust, and hair actually come out without me getting a utensil to dislodge it.It is really hard to get the filter out of the bottom. It recommends rinsing and drying both filters regularly, but that is really hard to do.Despite those problems, it is very easily to move the vacuum around. The thing just swivels beautifully. And it really cleans, there is a lot of suction so it picks up a surprising amount of dirt. Out house is around 900 square feet, and I can clean the whole thing very well in a short amount of time.Pros-It is quieter than our old vacuum. Compared to a dirt devil, it is much better.-Maneuvers incredibly well. It is very easy to do an entire room very quickly-Fairly light weight-Cleans very well, sucks up a lot of dirt.-Compact, fits neatly in a closet.Cons--Confusing to use the first several times.-The release catch to get the dirt out doesn't help that much, I usually have to get a utensil to dislodge everything.-Not good if you have arthritis or any problem like that. A lot of the release catches require a lot of force, such as the ones to remove the filters.-Hard to use on stairs.",4.0,"Great, but  it is not as intuitive as it is supposed to be",1362700800,"03 8, 2013"

You can buy additional set to support the whole sofa or a bed.Four starts because:  1) the directions are kind of hard to figure out.  I eventually did, but the directions didn't help very much.  2) the set only includes enough slats for part of a sofa, and that's not clear on the box.  3) kind of expensive for what it is.

However it's important to note that I do not utilize this brewer every day. I have two to three cups per week, on average.It looks very nice and is easy to clean.

AX9FIZX89LNFQ,B0000DAQ8B,"C.V. May ""Searching for The Good Stuff""","[1, 1]","I bought this OXO Good Grips Mandoline Slicer about fours years a ago. It has served well. When you need to quickly slice lots of veggies, of a certain kind, where all slices are need be exactly the same thickness, a mandoline is called for, both at home and at restaurants.I had considered the classic restaurant grade French mandoline made by Matfer, but at over three times the price it was not justified in my opinion. I thought I could do just as well for less money. I was right, to a degree. Here is what I found:1. Potatoes. It requires a bit of force and speed (momentum)to slice potatoes, but it does work well. You can adjust thickness from very thin to thick with the thickness dial, or you can slice in such a way that you achieve those waffle cuts with holes for deep frying to make ""chips."" You can also julienne in matchsticks or make medium sized French Fries. It really works for that.2. Cucumbers, celery, zucchini, beets, cabbage, and other medium hard veggies: Can be sliced with medium force.3. Carrots:  Carrots can be very difficult. The blade just is not sharp enough to slice carrots without great force involved. Julienning chokes the small julienne blades.4. Very strong build, thick, tough textured plastic, durable quality all around. The blades do not rust...I like that part.5. Easy to clean. Pop in the dishwasher to ensure that all nooks and crannies are sanitized.6. Handsome styling, looks professional and acts like it though this is a consumer grade mandoline, not professional grade, so, in time I might trade up to the Matfer Mandoline if something ever happens to this. Otherwise, this mandoline is very good, not excellent, but very good. Four stars.I hope this was helpful to you.

I ended up getting the longer case, mainly because it was about half the price.  While this case certainly does a fine job of protecting the 8 inch long 47520 knife, the extra two inches in length is a little inconvenient.  Unfortunately for me, the shorter one wasn't the cheaper one.Although it is long, this case does accommodate the 47520 knife quite well.  The knife seats nicely, and the two sets of small rubber inserts inside the case, provides a firm grip on the blade that keeps it from sliding.  As some have noted, the rubber inserts can put marks on the blade.  I applied a little silicon spray to the rubber, and this seems to help with reducing the severity of the marks on the blade.  If you try this, be sure to wash the blade before use.The overall design of the case is fairly good, although the width could probably be safely reduced a bit.  The case is pretty rigid, reinforced by bands on the inside of the case.  The two latches that secure the case are easy to operate, and would probably take a long time to wear down.  The thin plastic hinge, hopefully will have a long life.  The exterior of the case has a slightly textured finish that may help provide a little better grip.While a custom made case like this is not a must have accessory, it is a pretty cool way to protect your blade, either in the kitchen drawer or when transporting.

I like that it doesn't have a teflon nonstick coating, since that's why we got rid of the electric grill (the coating had worn off, almost certainly ending up in our food). We live in an apartment with no space for a grill, so we use this for all our grilling (chicken, zucchini, mushrooms, and burgers- haven't made steak on it yet) and use the griddle for eggs and potatoes. I've been very happy with this purchase.This is the first grill/griddle we've had that's designed for stovetop use. It works well with our electric stovetop. It takes a little while to let the whole thing heat up to a high, even temperature, but the cast iron does a great job distributing and retaining the heat (be careful that you let it cool down adequately before trying to clean it and put it away). I have another Lodge cast iron piece, so this wasn't a surprise to me. Although the design seems simple enough, there are great details that really improve it's functionality. I like the wide rim around the edge, which prevents any cooking juices from running off and keep the stovetop clean. I like that the handles are cut into the grill, as opposed to sticking out (which would be risky, since they do get hot. the handles are large enough to grab comfortably, but don't take up too much of the cooking surface.This product is very heavy, so you might want to be careful about where you store it. I wouldn't want to store it anywhere I had to reach up for it or where it could tip over. It is narrow, so it's easy to find space to store it.

I purchased my first set of Farberware in the very early 1980's when I was just starting to take cooking seriously.  That was many pots and pans ago and when I got a chance to check out their latest product I was quite surprised and pleased to see all of the positive changes that they have made in the last 30 years.The first improvement that caught my eye was in the non-stick coating.  My older pans were discarded years ago because the Teflon coating scratched easily and eventually flaked off.  The coating on this set seems thicker and more durable, as a matter of fact they claim that you can use metal turners and spoons without the fear of damaging the coating.The next this that caught my eye was the a style of the pots and pans are much more modern and contemporary with rounded lines and glass lids.  The 3 quart saute pan has sloped side allowing the cook to easily stir the food with a spatula or large spoon.  The handles are nicely designed and the pots have a good, solid feel to them.However, there a couple of things that I am not all that crazy about with this set:*  Although there are aluminum inserts in the bottom of the pots and pans which allows them to get hot quickly, the stainless steel sides are poor conductors of heat when compared to aluminum or (especially) cooper.*  The stainless finish looks attractive but it is much harder to keep clean and it also scratches easier than anodized aluminum.*  This is a good starter set but be prepared to add some other pieces to the collection, especially if you cook for a large family or if you entertain.  I would want a larger sauce-pot as well as a bigger saute-pan.In conclusion, this is a good set for those looking for a great value and are replacing old, worn out sets.

Endorsed by some high-profile chefs, such as the Barefoot Contessa (Ina Garten) and Mario Batali, you might be led to think that no kitchen is complete without one of these draped across a tile floor.  Having used cheap knock-off mats before, I had my doubts.  Surprisingly, though, I have to say that I was really impressed by this little mat--although I'm still not sure that this incredible little luxury is worth the hefty price tag.The GelPro mat has a shock-absorbing gel core sandwiched between two layers of plastic.  Unlike cheaper foam-core mats, the GelPro mat is softer and really conforms to the shape of your foot.  Unlike mats with a thinner, less-viscous gel layer, the GelPro mat really does provide more comfort.Whether you are wearing shoes or walking on the mat barefoot, you will notice a difference while standing on the mat. It's not exactly a modern miracle, but the anti-fatigue effects do decrease the strain of standing in the kitchen for long periods of time.  This is certainly not a panacea for all back ailments or for all aching feet, but especially when you are barefoot or in socked feet, the mat does make a difference.  It's kind of the kitchen-floor equivalent to a memory foam mattress and really does the job well.The top of the mat is stain resistant and covered in easy to wipe down plastic.  The basket-weave pattern is certainly attractive, but you can buy the mat in a variety of patterns and colors to match your kitchen.  One concern is that the mat top is not puncture proof and the mat comes with warnings that you should not walk on it wearing high heels.  Knives, forks, and other kitchen implements propelled by gravity might similarly endanger the cover.According to the website, the bottom of the mat is made from a durable, polyester knit fabric that is engineered to resist bacteria, mold, and algae that can cause stains and odors.  The bottom covering certainly grips the underlying floor effectively, but given the nature of the fabric on the bottom of the mat, it is entirely possible that particles of food that might eventually creep under the mat might get ground into the fabric and become difficult to remove.Still, so far as I can tell, this little mat beats the competition. Please note, however, that I'm reviewing this mat for the Vine program: I'm fairly certain that even though I enjoy the thing thoroughly, I don't know that the price of this item is justified given that it is not a kitchen necessity.

Instead of a regular top you can put in the dishwasher, this lid is hinged on one side and can't be removed. Instead you need to wipe it clean every time, including the rubber gasket that seals it. The steam vent also needs to be removed and scrubbed off. You also can't use the pot to store rice, since the lid is part of the unit.These cons are minor hassles; above all this is a good machine and a good value.

The quality of the pops from the first efforts with our microwave were only moderately successful, so we tried an air popper for a while, but thought it made some rather dry, cardboardy kernels. A month or so ago our microwave gave up the ghost, so we replace it with a 1100 watt G.E. Just for kicks we gave the Nordic another try, and got better, but not great results. It seemed to me that it took an excessive amount of time for the first kernel to pop, and that it left too many unpopped kernels when the timer ran out. Increasing the time only led to burned kernels.Just on a whim, I tried putting a couple of tablespoons of water in the popper with no corn and gave it a 1.5 minute boil to pre-heat the vessel. I then dumped the water and added the corn, and gave it a pop session of a little more than 2 minutes. The first kernel popped a lot faster, and after 2 minutes very few unpopped kernels were left. I don't know if this will work for everyone, but with our oven, it gives pretty decent results. BTW, the Nordic's a very good general purpose microwave container.

I have used it twice so far with excellent results.  I have made Chili Con Carne as well as a traditional 'pot roast'.  For both dishes I followed recipes from my 'America's Test Kitchen' books, which recommends using a 6 quart oval pot, set to 'low' for 9 to 10 hours.I was a little surprised to see some of the other reviews, because I had no 'boiling' effect on the low setting.  There was a bit of slight bubbling of the food around the edges as it cooked, but nothing that seemed alarming.  When the food was done (10 hours later) a quick stir was all it took to reincorporate everything.  There was no burnt flavor, the meat was tender (the chili was out of this world!), and the veggies with the Pot Roast were just about right.I did have 2 complaints.  The exterior seemed quite hot as the food was cooking, so much so that the item cannot be placed on Corian-type counters (according to the instruction manual).  I have to put my bread board up on my stove and place the pot on that.  Also, the lid doesn't seem to sit very well.Otherwise, the item has performed well for me so far.

But the filter is thin, it doesn't ""push"" the water through the filter at an even rate, and needs frequent replacing.This probably only filters out 50% of the contaminants in regular faucet water.

(When pulling out the aluminum pins, be careful, you can accidentally pull the particle board apart. I used a pair of needle-nosed pliers and wiggled them gently out.) I didn't like being without my box spring and with the box spring in there the shelves in the headboard were too low.

It wasn't until I received it that I read all of the previous reviews of this item.I made a chicken stew using chicken breast, potatoes, parsnips, turnips, carrots, and onions. I filled it to the top, added liquid, and set it on low to cook.I checked every half hour or so, and cooking went well. There are grooves in the top crock edge to vent excess steam. Because I had filled mine to the top, some liquid escaped and collected there. Next time I will know better to not fill it completely to the top, but leave some space.While I had expected my stew to cook for eight hours, it was actually done after six. After consulting the manual, I noted a FAQ that said that the cooking times, and assumably cooking temperature, will vary with line voltage. My line voltage is 127VAC, so I expect that is why my stew cooked faster. If you have a standard 120VAC line voltage, you'll be closer to the advertised cooking times.Other reviewers commented on the lid feeling cheap or thin; I disagree. The lid is substantial and just as big as it needs to be. It's slightly lesser diameter than the crock, which again allows for excess steam to escape.Overall I'm pleased with it. I need to experiment with it some more, but I have no doubt that it will do a good job of simmering chili or spaghetti sauce all day.

It sure beats hand mashing or bringing out the hand mixer to do the job. Clean-up is easy. Just rinse it out in the sink, then toss it in the dishwasher. Never rusts. So glad I ran into this quality at this price.It is all stainless steel, except for the plastic inserts on the handle, not the usual, cheaper tinned steel.

I don't know what kind of slicer the one-star reviewer used before, but it must have been amazing to slam the Zyliss so badly.To Lyndee's positive review, I can only add a couple of things. I can't even imagine how much sideways or twisting force it would take to ""derail"" the guide. The guide is a long, heavy plastic piece with a ""C"" profile that engages the track slots top and bottom.I also like the fact that there are guide slots on both sides, so  whether you're a lefty or righty you can put the guard on the side you want it.I have medium-sized hands, and I find the pusher piece perfectly comfortable - and if it were smaller, the one-star poster would be griping about having to cut everything up to get it to fit into the guard tube. As it is, you can comfortably get a decent sized potato in there.I also don't understand how you can get to the point that you're randomly jamming in the inserts into their storage box to the point that you're bending things. Friendly household tip - don't force things. Plus, there's no real need to have more than one insert out at a time anyway - they are clearly labeled in such a way that you only have to slide them out of the holder a half inch and you can see exactly which insert you've got.And it's perfectly simple to store this upright. Slide the insert box onto the guide rails so that the open end is facing the tall end of the slicer. Then slide the guard onto the rail from the top. Put the pusher piece into the food tube from the underside, lower the guard and slide it up against the inserts - the edge of the guard will slip between a couple of the inserts. At that point, you can store it sitting on the flat end of the insert box, or hang it by the tall legs from a pot rack, which is where mine is right now.I also don't understand where the blade risk is when properly stored. First, as Lyndee points out, storing a few inches of razor in dark places is probably not the best idea. But if you've stored it properly, you'll notice something. The thickest insert (mine says 7mm, roughly 1/4 inch) is longer than the other inserts. They made it that way for a reason. This is the insert you clip in to store the slicer, and it underhangs the blades quite safely. With the insert box covering the blade from the top, and the long insert covering the blade from the bottom, you'd have to be seriously talented and determined to touch the blade edge.This is a good unit - the only reason I gave it 4.49 stars is that it's a plastic unit, and there are metal ones for a comparable price. On the flip side - the plastic seem strong enough, and in two years of routine use, mine still works like new.",4.0,Nicely sliced,1209772800,"05 3, 2008"

I often use a crock-pot for easy, multi-serving meals (whole chicken, pot roast, stew / chili, etc.) and love the convenience of being able to dump in the ingredients, turn it on, and leave it for 4-8 hours without having to worry about anything.The new Hook Up line gives you the ability to link up to 6 Hook Up crock-pots for parties or potlucks... a cool idea if you have friends or family with compatible units who can get together.

With the Hook up units, you and friends/family can combine your powers to provide a wide variety of slow cooker dishes using a single power outlet. Roasts, soups/stews, and dips can all be made side-by-side.

A303SNZ4AR7TDQ,B0015ASJIY,SirStinky,"[21, 21]","We bought this to replace another Eureka vacuum we got to replace our Hoover WindTunnel (great vacuum, never had a problem, and served us faithfully for 8 years).The first Eureka we bought (the Capture Plus), was a disaster, it kicked the bucket in just 6 months, and it wasn't abused. The Boss SmartVac came highly recommended, and the price was right ($[...]).Consumer Reports rated the Boss Ultra as one of the best vacuums in a comparison against some of the best vacuums on the market (think Kirby... Rainbow). I can't deny that claim now that I've owned it. The Boss has excellent suction and cleans as good, if not better than vacuums costing $300, 400, 500 more. I've used Kirbys, Dysons, Hoovers, Rainbows, and others, and this one works great. It's loaded with useful features too. It's got a motorized brush roll (beater bar) that turns off when you aren't using it on carpets. You can switch the suction mode, and there's a function for bare (hard) floors and adjustible brush height. The hose stretches out nice and long, and the tools are of good quality. This is a bagged vacuum, so it won't clog easily, and it's hygenic: Just replace the bag. Eureka claims this is one of the best filtering vacuums out there, and it may be, but despite having true 3-stage HEPA filtration, there's some particulates that get by them. Still, good filtration for the money. If you're looking for good filtration, try one of Rainbow's water vacuums, but in terms of cost, the Eureka is more attractive.There are some reliability issues with this machine though. The motor is very powerful...12 amps. It's an excellent powerhead, delivering astounding suction for a small unit, and it's reliable. That power can be a problem though. If you manage to suck up a rug, curtain, stuffed animal, pet toy, or other object (if you're not careful you will, it's that powerful), it can cause some serious problems. The belt isn't made from regular rubber, it's a synthetic that Eureka claims lasts longer than rubber. That may be true, but it doesn't stand up to abuse, and if overheated, is ruined. Rubber belts can take that abuse much better. also, the brushrool bearing caps are plastic, and suceptable to overheating and melting. You can't readily replace them either. Plus, the vacuum is made almost eitirely of plastic, which is good for weight savings (it's still on the heavy side though at about 23 lbs), but bad for durability. It's questionable however, because if you're not abusive to this machine, you shouldn't have any issues with it. Out of 10 Bosses, 10 will probably be fine. We bought this from CostCo, which has a no-questions-asked return policy, so if it breaks, we'll send it back and get another one.",4.0,Excellent value for the money,1231113600,"01 5, 2009"

A1ZM846Y7AUYD,B000MUUPSA,M. Pickering,"[40, 43]","Simplehuman is a great company that produces some extremely interesting products for your home.  They have chosen an unusual product line, which includes items like garbage cans, toilet plungers, soap dispensers, and of course the slim toilet brush.  Well, I guess somebody has to make them, and Simplehuman does a fabulous job.  Not only do they concentrate on making quality products but they have taken great strides in making these everyday items extremely stylish.  These products are things that you would expect to see in homes of the very wealthy, and yet the prices of their products are very affordable.  Still, some may hesitate spending $30 or more dollars on something as simple as a toilet brush.  Well folks, this is no ordinary toilet brush!I can't say enough about the looks of this brush set.  Brushed stainless steel and black have proven to make a stylish look in the kitchen, but who would have thought that this combination would make its way into your bathroom?  Well Simplehuman thought it was a great idea and I must agree.  This toilet brush is slim and sleek, from the easy to remove brush itself to the holder, which has a nice pivot-open door and removable tray (for easy cleaning).  The brush head is replaceable, which is a great feature, but you may have a hard time finding replacement heads.  I buy mine directly from the Simplehuman website, which sells them for $4.99 each.  Not a bad price at all.  If you prefer white instead of stainless steel, Simplehuman sells this same slim toilet brush in white as well.  The brush head has stiff outter bristles, for scrubbing tough stains, while the inner bristles are softer and fuller for regular cleaning.I have gone on and on about how great this toilet brush looks, and yet I only give it a 4-star rating.  Why is this?  Well, as stunning as this brush and holder look, using it is slightly less satisfying; at least at first.  Don't get me wrong, it works quite well, but it takes some getting used to.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is no rounded end to this brush, which is fairly custumary on most toilet brushes.  This makes it a little difficult to scrub way down into the drain opening of the toilet bowl.  Also, the brush is quite slim, so you will have to get used to holding the brush for proper scrubbing.  If you hold it wrong the brush will try to turn, which causes the handle to twist in your hand.  Still, after using this brush a few times you quickly learn how to get excellent results.  The stiff outer bristles are great for scrubbing under the rim of the toilet bowl, and the shape of the brush head is designed perfectly for this task.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Simplehuman Slim Toilet Brush, and I would definately buy it again.  If you are looking for a toilet brush that you won't have to hide away, and you are patient enough to allow yourself to get used to the unique shape and design of the curved brush head, then I would highly recommend this Simplehuman toilet brush.  It truly is the best looking brush and holder set on the market today.  The difficulty of using this brush to clean deep into the drain of the toilet bowl prevents me from giving this set a full 5 stars, but I certainly consider it a 4 and 1/2 star item.  And I can honestly tell you that Simplehuman's customer service staff are extremely friendly and will go the extra mile to make sure you are a satisfied customer.  Give the Simplehuman Slim Toilet Brush a home in your bathroom, and you are sure to receive a lot of compliments from others who visit your loo.  =o)",4.0,"At Last, a Toilet Brush That You Don't Have To Hide Away!",1202342400,"02 7, 2008"

You cannot make up your own rules & succeed when sharpening.Think of music timing/rythm each knife will have a different count because of different lengths.Simply make up your own counts / timing or rythm for your knives.Counting on the straight & parrallel 1,2,3,4 ect and then lift the handle 1,2,3 when you reach the curve of the blade.Count the number of pull strokes in each slot while alternating slots Left side of blade, then Right of blade.You will eventually acquire a feel for the angles & the magnetic guide pull.This sharpener is a great little sharpener for what it is. I paid $39.99 day after x-mas.I  basically needed something inexpensive & accurate to re-grind a knife edge accurately prior to the honing process.You must be careful to position perfectly with the magnets & keep the knife moving while pulling If not stage 1 might leave a neat concave gouge in the blades edge like my TV cheap knife.***I  also ground the neat groove out using Stage 1 as well.Two of my magnets feel too weak to hold the knives well.(I'm taking this unit back to be exchanged within 10 days)Thin non serrated TV knives shake & whip side to side, they dont suffer cosmetic scratches from magnet guides as much as thicker blades. Thin blades did sharpen eventually with practice though.It didn't do worth squat sharpening a meat cleaver. Practice didn't help.I don't think the black plastic guide slots will last long.I  sharpened 10 knives (50minutes of use when I first brought it home) & the bottom of the slots already have knife marks in them. Not to mention a few plastic shavings on the countertop.The Step 2 & 3 hones that vibrate & shake like paint shakers are annoying.If you pull the knife too slow the hones will leave slightly noticable chatter marks on the side of the blade bevel & edge.I found that using slightly faster pulls/strokes all the time for steps 2 & 3 ""imitates"" a sharpening steel.I  did get the feel for the sharpener it DOES NOT grind all of your metal away leaving you with a toothpick knife.I  might get a diamong grit sharpening steel anyway as I'm old fashioned.",4.0,Its a nice sharpener for $39.99 on sale day after x-mas.,1167091200,"12 26, 2006"

A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B005D62ZQS,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 5]","I own the Margaritaville DM1000 Frozen Concoction Maker and have absolutely loved using it.  It was been a huge hit at parties and makes the perfect margarita.  So when I was given the opportunity to try out the new Mixed Drink Maker, I just had to jump on it.  This machine is completely different from the Margarita makers in that it acts like a digital bartender.  It comes with four containers and the upside and downside is that, in order to really use it, you have to follow the instructions and use the specific mixers.So how it works.  The first container is for the liquor and the directions are specific in the kinds of liquor to use, i.e. vodka, rum or tequila.  The next container is for cranberry juice, then sour mix and finally orange juice.  The machine has a roster of 48 recipes based on these four ingredients, broken down into whether you're using rum, vodka or tequila.  Once you've selected the recipe you want, the machine mixes up the correct combination of ingredients and puts out an 8 ounce drink.  The machine recommends using 16 ounce cups (I use the red cups because you know it's not a party without those (in)famous cups) with ice in them.  The machine, unlike the margarita makers, obviously doesn't keep things cold.  In fact, it recommends chilling the containers of ingredients in the fridge prior to putting them in the machine.  The Mixed Drink Maker also has two fun little additions.  The first is a roulette wheel where you can say ""surprise me"" and it'll randomly choose a drink for you that you can accept or not.  This has been a big hit at parties, adding a fun little mystery or randomness to the drinks and mimics the traditional ""surprise me"" someone might ask a bartender.  The other fun little addition is the ability to make a drink stronger.  If you do this, it will put an extra ounce of liquor and one fewer ounce of mixer into the drink so it stays at 8 ounces.  Very nifty.  The top of the machine pops out, so you can empty the reservoirs, which lift out.The biggest drawback to this machine is that it's only as good as the recipes.  So every drink you make will involve a combination of orange juice, cranberry juice and/or sour mix.  Granted, there's 48 recipes spread amongst three different liquors, but in the end it's still all based around three different mixers.  Since the entire thing is digitized and based off of its own internal recipe listing, you really can't change the ingredients around.  I mean, I guess you could but when you pressed ""screwdriver"" but you don't have the right ingredients, it will just give you a mixture based on what's in the containers.  So while there are ways of circumventing the system, it's not exactly recommended.  Additionally, there's obviously nothing stopping you from adding additional flavors or mixers to the drinks it creates but it sort of defeats the purpose of a digitized barkeep.In the end, there's really not anything negative to say about this machine.  48 recipes is a good amount and truthfully there's a good variety to be had amongst the three mixers and liquors.  It's been a huge hit at a party that frees me up to actually have fun instead of standing behind my bar, mixing drinks all night.  This, like all of the Margaritaville machines, is a fantastic party device and while I can't recommend it as highly as the margarita machine, it still is fun...if you have a couple hundred just lying around.",4.0,"A fun, kind of novelty, drink item",1323820800,"12 14, 2011"

It's pretty much what I thought the product would be. I just wish I had waited to buy.

While I like that the feet have non-slip grips on them, they make the device bigger than it needs to be.- Kinda heavy (it's not super heavy or hard to lift, it's just heavier than I thought it would be)- For average sized products only. It limits the width and thickness of the rolls you can buy (certain foils come in wider sizes and bulk items are very thick). However, if it was made to fit bigger rolls, this would increase its bulkiness.- Could be easier to grab the start of the roll.

The primary PLUS I suppose is that this item is WONDERFUL for STOPPING HEAT ... and I assume that is the primary reason you buy this.. it is essentially impervious to any heat that you'd normally encounter.. also its nicely lined with a soft and comfortable material, and reaches well up your arm to protect that as well.. how many times have you burned your wrist on the rack or oven side while reaching for a hot item? However it does have it's problems!!1. The most critical thing is the poor ""flex pattern"" which makes picking up items and gripping them very awkward. In the least case, I'd order TWO of these if you feel this is the glove you want.. this is so you can use both hands to grip anything you want to pick up.. this is the only way you'll really get much of a grip and be confident that you can move hot items safely to where you're going.2. This fits poorly. I have largish hands I guess but many men especially will have even larger hands.. the fingers are more than adequate.. they in fact are too long.. 1.5"" longer than my fingers.. but it also is very tight around my knuckles (where the fingers join your hand) and even tighter if you try to ""grip"" something. Though this makes it slightly uncomfortable, the main reason I mention it is that I worry that this MAY eventually pull the seam out..3. Of lesser issue, but still to be considered is that the material, though tough and rubbery, CAN BE TORN on any jab by a sharp or pointed surface.. and of course once this is done, the glove is pretty much not going to serve it's purpose anymore.I've looked at other gloves and most have similar or worse problems.

The problem with either of these methods is that my floor is left with a film of dirt and detergent after I'm done.The big advantage of the Hoover Floormate over the mop and bucket is that it applies a solution of detergent and clean, hot water to the floor, scrubs it with the rotating brushes, and then sucks the dirty water back into a separate holding container.Like other reviewers, I didn't find using the FloorMate as a dry vacuum to be very effective, so I begin my cleaning process by vacuuming the floor.I also didn't find that the FloorMate did a very good job cleaning my very dirty grout.

A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H,B000F49XXG,Carlgo,"[1, 1]","You get a free machine as a gift, then get hooked on caffein. Then you start buying cups and special grinds of expensive coffee, high-end coffee grinders, frothing cups and thermometers. In the end you are hooked and the coffee cartel prospers. I am now addicted and it is costing me time and money. I live for my high. It is awful.The EC155 seems to be right at the lowest price point for a decent machine. It features a stainless steel boiler, dual thermostats and a powerful pump, all features of expensive machines and not the features of cheaper ones. It looks nice, feels substantial and works quite well.This is how these things work: the boiler heats the water, the pump pushes it through a slug of strong finely ground coffee and it ends up in a little tiny cup or two and with a layer of ""crema"", that light colored head that is a feature of espresso. Think of it like the head on a beer. It looks good and adds to the taste and experience of drinking it.There is a whole lot of lore regarding just how the coffee is held in place so the water can go through it properly. The EC155 comes with two sizes of filter/holders, one suitable for one shot and the other for two. These are unique in that they are pressurized. The water is pumped into them until the pressure builds up and then at a certain point they open up and the water can flow through the coffee and into your cup. Higher end machines generally rely on the density of the coffee to impede the flow of the water just so. If it flows too slowly it can be bitter, too fast and it is weak. Check the internet for a million pages of advice on how to do this properly. Know that in the end, it depends on individual machines, the brand and grind of coffee and of course the coffee gods and coffee demons.The pressurized filter on the EC155 eliminates that geekiness as the water flows the same regardless of how tightly you pack it (""tamping"") and it also allows the use of the little packets that you can just drop in. Some people cut the pressure valve off in order to achieve some other level of perfection. I would strongly advise buying a more expensive machine for that level of enthusiasm.In the end, with the EC155 you don't have to do anything but put a packet in it or some loose coffee and then just give it a light tamping and you are done. This is good for most consumers.One component of espresso is the frothed milk you can add to a brewed cup, and the designs you can make as you pour it in. DeLonghi recommends skim milk. Some use 1 or 2% and others half and half. The more fat content, the more difficult it is to froth properly. The more fat content, the better it tastes (as in all things).Frothing is done with steam directed into the milk with a wand that has its own setting and control. The milk really expands and you look for a shiny sea of foamy thick milk, not a bunch of big bubbles. It takes a great deal of practice to really get this right. I am still somewhat inconsistent about it. The milk not only is a nice creamy addition for your espresso, the heating also sweetens it up. I find no need for sugar at all. And the left-over froth can be used in you regular coffee.I found that a chilled stainless 12 oz frothing cup is best with this machine. The steaming wand is not really long enough for the common 20 oz cup unless you use a lot of milk. Just too much for a couple of ounces of coffee. I bought a cheapo frothing thermometer and found that it gave me more consistent results.Making espresso is a messy business and involves milk products which must be cleaned up quickly for reasons of health]. This machine is not too difficult to clean, but there are a number of things to take apart and you should have an easy to clean counter area for it.Be careful of steam. It is indeed genuine steam. Once I suffered a steam injury when repairing a solar system. Nasty. Don't let kids play with it.Things that could be better: the steam control should be a lever rather than a knob. The steam wand should be longer. The warm-up procedure is confusing. You need to let it warm up for 15-20 minutes, even though the ready light comes on in a few minutes. Ready should be ready and you should not have to look at a clock! It is not particularly good for serving a lot of people, more suited for an individual or couple.You can buy packets of coffee, cans of espresso or get a special burr coffee grinder that produces a better grind of espresso than the more common, and cheaper, blade type grinder. I have been using canned.The EC155 is made in China. Good for DeLonghi, bad for Italy.In the end you get a nice tasty espresso that will certainly do to get you going in the morning. It doesn't cost a fortune. It is a fun little hobby if you have the time and are willing to work a little at it.

Second, you can remove the top half of the cone mechanism for cleaning which is great and the bean reservoir is easily removed for cleaning as well  The only negatives are that the container into which the ground coffee is collected has a flimsy hinged lid that may not last.

I tested it out with a few US coins (penny=2.5g, nickel=5g), and it was dead on.* The tare function (subtract out the weight of a container) is simplicity itself. Put the container on the scale, press the on/off button, and the weight of the container is now ignored.* The black and silver finish looks like it belongs in my kitchen.  The included measuring bowl also serves as a cover for the scale,=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The scale is made out of some cheap-looking materials. The base of the scale is a shiny black plastic which collect fingerprints from across the room. THe clear bowl/cover is made of some cloudy looking plastic that looked filthy when it came out of the box, and has never really looked much better after washing. It really needs to be a nice clear polycarbonate.* The base of the scale is a little wobbly, especially on the side where the mode button is.* The mode button has 4 settings: ""g"", ""oz"", ""ozt"" and ""dwt"". I have no idea what the last two are for- they do not seem to be related to the tare function. I am sure I can go on using this scale in ""g"" mode without worrying about it.* The cover fits on a little too tight. It is a bit tough to get it off, and usually the scale will stick to the lid and then drop onto the counter. That can't be good for the thing.=== Summary ===The scale is perfectly serviceable, and has come in handy in the kitchen.

The pot is quite sturdy and without the coffee press/lid  it could also be used as a pitcher. The Press itself is incorporated into the lid, The knob on the lid is the top of the press/ plunger.  The reason I only give it 4 stars is because the only directions are on the box, I wish there was a piece of paper  with instructions even though this is easy enough to use that you might not need instructions anyway. The box has  reasonably complete instructions with a lot of emphasis on safe use. The press cleans easily,  so far as I know the press does not ,and is not supposed to come apart to clean.To make coffee in the press you add the coarse coffee grounds to the pot  add the hot water to the pot , put the lid/press on the pot with the press raised and lid closed and wait 5 minutes or so before gently lowering the press with the spout turned away from you to prevent any possibility of  being splashed with hot coffee.I like having a steel french press as the last press I had was glass and was broken quickly. This one is  bound to hold up a lot better.

A1G60ANYI0HMEU,B004BR3SR0,Jeddy 3,"[1, 2]","Let's start off by admitting the truth: This knife set looks cheap. It has that made-in-China look about it. The good news is: These are actually really nice knives, even if they don't look it.I've been using an old-school Hoffritz set of knives in an angled wooden block. I love 'em -- they're 20 years old and take an edge like nobody's business -- but I was ready to try a different design. This set was a very pleasant surprise. As soon as I picked up one of the big knives, I was reallly pleased by the balance and the ergonomics of the knife and the handle. These are substantial knives, so ergonomics and balance are very important to prevent fatigue when you use them. Of course, what's comfortable to one person may not suit another, but these babies felt great in my hand and they proved to be ridiculously sharp when I put them through their paces.The chef's knife and the smaller Santoku (called the ""Fusion"" in this set) are the blades that get the most use in my house, and these are a pleasure to use.  I particularly liked the balance and curve of the Santoku and bread knives. I have another Santoku, for which I paid nearly as much as this whole set costs, that doesn't feel as good in my hand as this one does. I've found that the steel is really high quality, as claimed; the knives dull slowly, and when they inevitably start to lose their edge, a quick, light run through myChef's Choice 120 Knife Sharpenerrestores them nicely.When I buy a product, I always like to know what people didn't like about it. So here goes:I don't like the scissors. They feel like an afterthought -- ugly, awkward in the hand and misaligned. I can't imagine using them much. But there's a space in the knife block for them -- odd, because don't most people keep scissors in a drawer? -- so it's either keep them there or have a blank spot in the block. I wish they had replaced the scissors with asharpening steel. I like to give my knives a few strokes before I use them and it's so convenient to have a steel right in the block.I don't like the knife block. I think it looks cheap. And I don't like the straight-up-and-down design. It won't fit in any space where there's an overhang. You really need at least 2 ft of vertical space above this block to pull out a knife, and my kitchen doesn't have any counter surfaces without overhangs above them. I finally figured out how to deploy the block; I put it on its edge on a shelf, surrounded by other items to hide its fugliness. The panels are tapered, so when the block is on its side, it's slightly angled up, which keeps the knives in.And finally, this may seem like a minor complaint, but a few of you out there will understand: I hate the logo. Really hate it. So much so that I considered giving these quality knives 3 stars just to punish whoever designed it (a 6th grader using MS Paint, I'm guessing). It's a cheap and dreadful mishmosh of caps, lower case, small caps, Helvetica light and Helvetica bold, adorned with a misconceived checkerboard pattern. The whole thing is a slap in the retinas to me. Also, memo to the company: Chef's Toolbox, not Chefs Toolbox, unless the company was founded by someone whose last name is Chefs.If you think I'm nuts for caring about the logo, then get this knife set without hesitation, as long as you don't really need the useless scissors. If you understand what it means to have a beef with huge and ugly logos blaring in your kitchen, do yourself a favor and, before you plunk down your cash, take a good zoomed-in look at the thing on the Amazon product photo.Summary: Really nice basic knife set, fine steel, awkward presentation. Worth buying? Study the product photo, consider your personal taste and kitchen design, and you make the call.UPDATE: I've been using these knives quite heavily for 3 months. I find that now they're the first knives I reach for for any task. I actually really like having the knife block on its edge, between other items on the shelf -- it's a real space saver and conceals the unpleasant parts of the design. I still hate the logo, and I've permanently banished the scissors, but dang, I really love these knives. I've had several occasions to sharpen them, and they take an edge beautifully. Usually all they need is a quick trueing with the steel (from another set), and they're sharp enough to cut tomatoes. They feel so good and cut so well that I've pretty much given up my lovely, wooden-handled, full-tang, classy-looking Hoffritz knives.

This model (which we haven't yet tried) looks to be the same except it now has indicators for the temperatures different types of food should be cooked at.Assuming it cooks the same it has some neat features. First and foremost the top cover is attached with a spring to the cooker. On other models we looked at Presto was the only one we found that had this. It may not seem like a big deal but if you're working with hot oil and frying it's nice to not have to completely remove the lid and find some place to put it down while putting in more food. Also, many other models required that the lid be removed before you can hook the basket over the lip to drain your food. In the Presto this is all done UNDER the closed cover...excellent!There was one issue however. After a number of years of usage the cover did not seal completely which allowed condensation to build up around the outside. We're giving this a pass on the new model because there is a top cover now that can be removed to ""vent"" the condensation.Overall, we found this to be a pretty good product at a reasonable price.

I like it a lot that said if youre like me and scaling down from a vacuum shop $3-400 dollar higher grade model this one will seem cheap and not as powerful. I know duh! LOLI previously owned a simplicity 7250 (made by panasonic) it was awesome I swear it cleaned under side of rug from top LOL. But its old and needs a thorough maintenance upgrade and its too costly for its age.I thought Id try this one because I wanted a panny' since they run quieter then most store bought vacs', I live in an apartment and tend to need to use it late (my neighbors say they never hear it!). This mcug471 is very quiet in fact quieter then my better one I retired, you can have a conversation without yelling.Its very plastic compared to the durable plastic the higher grade models are made of, I think if I bump it around too much Its a goner as the wheels are mounted in cheapo plastic or appear to be as well as rest of it. ( the higher price ones can be fixed completey all over). Vacuumng bare floors needs to be done with tools and can be cumbersome since tubes arent very long...I can use my old tools from prev panny bac but this could be a problem for some.That said it does a nice job, I have low shag rug from eighties and carpet runners which it transitions too very easily unless you have fringes but theyd all choke that up.ITs not heavy to me because my higher grade panny' was really heavy..they prob' are heavier then most tho' which is why the thing is quieter then the high pitch the really cheapos have.The cord winder is awesome, I hope its durable and doesnt wear on cord, I really like the auto wind up function.The tools are great especially the power paw thing...its a small tool with its own rotating brush you put on tube to do couch or other and its suction is great!Its an easy vac to use and store, and I like the hepa filter.My old panny bags fit and tools (if I use the extended hose I have from my old panny I have to put it in the hole where you connect the hose on the vacc of this one) I clean car this way.The hose on this vacuum is very flexible, not cheap or stiff, will wear well I think, my expensive old one had a stiffer hose that wore.I like the grip area on back to lift it with, helps not wear on handle.Time will tell on wear of this unit but it is really nice for the price. I cant be sure how it would do on higher pile rugs, I think Id rather one with manual adjust vac height if I had thicker carpets.It comes with one bag installed (mine did anyway) I will buy high filter bags tho'they do a great job at holding dust and vac.If you cant spend a ton on a vacuum (300 and up in specialty shops) then this one is a good medium, I do recc'd it.VACUUM USES THE FOLLOWING BAGS BELTS: ub8 belts, and style u bags (u3/6).",4.0,"Nice for price, quiet too, awesome couch / car / stair tool !",1258588800,"11 19, 2009"

So far (we've had them about 6 months), I'm very pleased.

The real problem with them were how badly stained they got in the dish washer - one guest described them as ""rusty"" and wouldn't use them (it's not really rust, just stain, but still), so the next day they got replaced with a set of Chicago Cutlery that are dishwasher safe and have a better heft to them.The other knives of the set continue to hold up very well - they're all still nice and sharp after 3 years of nearly daily use. I will say, I sometimes do throw them in the dishwasher (which the instructions say not to do) and some have a spot or two of stain from this.

All you have to do to add years to your life and prevent all sorts of old age problems is stand up half the day! OK, so I was sold. It made me feel less slothful to stand anyway - kind of a cool mental boost. But it didn't take me long to realize why you need a good anti fatigue mat. My feet felt achy... so did my calves.After checking out a few of the higher priced anti fatigue mats, as well as some other thicknesses and softness levels, the Fiore takes the lead for me as the best mat for the price if you are standing for hours at a time. I now have a sit-stand station at work (computer and desk style), and I stand for at least half of my 8 hour shift... sometimes more. The softer mats do not provide enough support for standing long periods of time, and the harder ones are a waste of time as they do nothing to cushion your feet and legs. This mat is really just right; it bounces back just enough to give you support, but it has enough give/softness to provide relief. It's also fairly priced compared to many of the other mats out there.Note: do NOT stand on this mat in high heels - it will damage the mat.

IMO, the only thing this unit does better than a drip coffee maker from 50 years ago is that it beeps when it's done.  Not a big enough improvement to justify an $80 price tag, but I didn't see much cheaper, and I *do* like the Kitchenaid brand.Good things:Makes good coffee (not really a difficult task)Large, easy to pour-into reservoir (my previous Gevalia coffee maker had a very narrow opening)Beeps when readyAnnoyances I can live with:I haven't seen the leaking that others have reported, but that may happen in the future.To lift the lid on the carafe, you push down on a tab with your thumb like almost all other makers.  But they've designed it in such a way that you have to push it down into this narrow area cut out of the handle.  It would be fine for a child or petite-sized woman, but an adult male thumb will not fit into this hole.  So I have to hold the handle with three fingers and bend my index finger up to open the lid.You cannot empty all of the liquid out of the carafe.  The plastic band around the top is designed so that a tablespoon of water (or coffee) gets trapped.  The only way of getting most of it out is to shake it vigorously over the sink.I have no major gripes about the machine.  I'm happy with the coffee I'm getting out of it.

The first one I had purchased was a pain the nehind, being as the score line would never be straight. This one, I get a straight cut time after time. NOW the tricky part of seperating the score line. I read that you fill the bottle up PAST the score line with BOILING water. I have a tea kettle, so basically, when it starts to whistle. I pull it off, fill up my mesauring cup, fill the bottle and use an ice cube right away on the score line. BE careful, holding the ice in one spot for too long can make the score line go elsewhere. Tonight, I was able to score and seperate 9 bottles out of 12. 3 ended up not working so well. But it seemed to be more with the green bottles. I did have one clear one that the score line went off, but that was my first one, I did 5 more clear bottles like that, no problems.NOW my complaint. The part that sits inside the bottle is starting to break, which I may have applied too much pressure. Being as rereading the book, you do not need to use a lot of pressure, which I was trying to strong arm this. BUT it still disappoints me that it does have this flaw.

A37OYVYHR5U4NU,B00EJQQP46,Freudian Slips,"[0, 0]","This is a great little vacuum-- it rolls around easily, has great suction, and it's easy to switch back and forth between the various attachments.  This is the first time I have tried a bagless vacuum and I have to admit that actually seeing all the dust and junk from my floor is a little disconcerting but perhaps will inspire me to vacuum more often. :)I have a lot of pet hair in my house and I really like the quality of the bristles on the hard floor tool.  Usually, those type of implements just catch the hair in the bristles and you have to pull the nest of hairs off and throw it away with your hands.  Not this brush-- the hair goes right into the vacuum.I have only a few complaints, which are relatively minor.  The first is that the cord is awfully short, in my opinion.  I had to constantly unplug it and move it to do my floors.  That's easily solved, I guess, with an extension cord, but I would have preferred a longer cord.My second complaint is that I thought the instruction book was a little confusing.  Normally I don't read the instructions for vacuums-- but since this was a new type for me, I read them.  First, they helpfully labeled all the parts of the vacuum in the carton contents section (A,B,C and so on).  But then in each following section they started over and renamed the parts.  So what was ""A"" in the first diagram wasn't ""A"" anymore.  ""D"" in the first part is the telescoping want-- but then ""D"" becomes the Hand Grip in the next diagram.  Unnecessarily confusing, I thought-- they should have kept the same letter and then used ""A1"" or A2"" to label the different sub-parts.  Also-- at one point they tell you to wash the filter in warm water-- maximum 40 degrees Celsius.  Ah-- the instructions were probably not written in the US.  Otherwise, they would have said 104 degrees Fahrenheit. So that might explain the instruction issues.All in all, a great appliance and at an excellent price compared to Dyson and other similar products.

I also have all hardwood floors. I needed an upgrade from the stick vac I had been using as it really wasn't doing the job very well. (Not that it isn't good but just not good enough for full house cleaning.) So the search started for something well priced, lightweight and good succion.For the most part, I am very happy with this vacuum. It met most of the needs I was looking for. It could be a little lighter but I'm coming from a stick vac so it just takes a little getting used to. It's definitely still lighter than some of the other models I was looking at. The suction is great and the floors feel very clean after vacuuming. When running it along a wall, it does a good job of picking up dirt on the sides which is really nice. I'm undecided about the handle. It was kind of awkward at first but I got used to ut. Not really sure it makes for more movability as claimed.A few negative things to point out if it applies to your situation. This vacuum does not lay as flat as I would have liked. I have a low profile bed so getting under it was not possible without moving to the attachments. There is a smaller air-turbine brush that you can use on the attachment hose but it is not really very wide and I don't think that's what it was intended for.I do have to say that the air-turbine brush clogged up pretty quickly and hair got tangled up in it easily causing the rotation of the bristles to stop until I removed it all. Also, the attachment hose is not nearly long enough to really get under or behind things (such as the bed, under consoles & shelving). I really do wish the attachment hose extended or had another piece you could add to make it longer. I really had to stretch to get deeper under the bed and under a cabinet or behind smaller spaces with the turbine brush.Emptying the canister, as other reviewers mentioned, isn't the best design. You unlatch the bottom of the canister rather than pour it out from the top or side. So when you release the latch over a garbage can, dirt gets on your hands if you don't get it out of the way fast enough. But if you aren't careful when you open it, it kind of dumps dirts everywhere. Because the door opens downward, you have to allow a certain amount of space causing a bit of dust cloud. I'm not really sure I'm explaining this correctly but let's just say it could be better.All in all, if I could start the search over with some of the things I know to look for now, I think I would have gone with something else.

But before it would operate the first time, I had to fix the filter against the micro switch on the unit. There is no troubleshooting which told me to do that, I figured it out.Once it was running, there are three speeds that you can select from. Except for the lowest speed the other two produces a fan noise that is too loud for a bedroom.  The lowest setting, which seems to work fine, is sort of a white noise, which helps me sleep.As with others who have pets, the absence of any pet odors indicates the purifier is working. Air is pulled in the front of the unit and blows out the back. So, careful placement is needed. I have it placed near the heating register, which maybe helps clean the air coming from there.I do notice a slight buildup of dust on the outside of the cabinet, have to keep it clean!Comparing it to another purifier we have, the Sharper Image air ionizer, I don't smell any ozone from this one.I would have given 4 stars except for having to periodically replace the filter in the unit, an added expense.

I used my first silicone, heat resistant spatula many years ago. They have a wooden handle and I always have to take them apart to wash them for fear of what might grown in the gap. They are looking pretty rough. So getting a set of these from StarPack to test out was perfect for replacing my old yucky ones.There are many great qualities about this set. The color is beautiful and rich and will look great in any kitchen. They don't stain and wash up super easily - no gaps to catch food and other yucky things. The solid construction means that they are hard to break and will last for a long time. The handles are super smooth and weighted nicely. The edges are beveled and flat on one side, curved on the other. Great for cleaning out bowls or scraping flat surfaces. They also have a hole at the bottom if you want to hang them. Best of all, you can use them while cooking for things up to 450 degrees.

At the same time, I contacted Neato and they sent several sets of replacement bearings that I can use when these wear down.

I wanted something that my big smelly dogs could lay on without stinking up all of my couch cushions. Normal couch covers looked stiff and plastic-y. I wanted something that looked and felt like a blanket, yet had a backing that strong scents couldn't get through. I also wanted something that would match my rustic cabin decor. So when I found this 'Hunter Green' waterproof blanket I was thrilled. The price wasn't too bad either!When I got the blanket I was a bit surprised to see that the actual color of the blanket was blue with green diamond accents amidst the plaid. The backing was green, but the plaid 'blanket' side was mostly blue. At first I was disappointed, because green is one of my favorite colors (blue is not), but it's grown on me.The waterproof side is very silky, yet it stays in place nicely. I can lean the back of the blanket up against the back cushions of the couch and it stays up nicely. It also doesn't slip around when my dogs jump up onto their seat.The blanket side is very soft. I was actually surprised how soft it was. It feels like flannel- and looks that way too. The plaid color scheme is very universal and fits nicely into my decor. It's comfy enough for both my dogs and I to sit on. And it stretches entirely across the two cushions of my love seat- which works really well for when one of the pups wants to fully outstretch.It's done its job to keep odors from getting into the cushions. It also does an awesome job of keeping mud and fur from sticking to the couch as well. I've actually begun using it for other things. I take it to the boat to use on the seat when we travel during the rainy season. I also take it camping to lay on the bottom of the tent. In the summer I plan on using it for picnics. It would be a bit small for a family picnic- but is sized appropriately for a couple, or for about 4 children to share.All in all, I'm very happy with the blanket.

By-the-way, those who complain about the lid being difficult to unscrew to the ""pour position"" and that the coffee then doesn't stay hot are nuts.  There is no pour position.  The lid stays in place during the brewing cycle and during pouring afterward.  It self seals.  If you are unscrewing the lid, for some insane reason, you are needlessly breaking the seal, which is why your coffee is getting cold.  Mine stays hot for easily five hours.And for those who have ""the 10 cup version"" and try to piggy back whatever problems they've had with it onto this unit, I would just say that this coffee maker DOES NOT HAVE a 10 cup version.

For the outdoor use, I used screamin' meemie RED duct tape to wrap around the handles so they wouldn't get lost. After all, black handles on soil or leaf litter just begs to be lost and NEVER found until old and rusty! LOLWhat I love about these scissors is 1) the very large openings, which you can grab with either hand, with wet hands or with gloved hands. NO NEED to take off garden gloves or flip the scissor around to the correct hand to use them. 2) NO stupid spring to *pop* out and lose! I can't count the amount of shears/scissors that I've had to toss because the spring either rusted or got lost. 3) To the point ""point"", you can really zero in on an area that needs to be snipped.

Did you ever wonder what God's intention for lemons were when he created them?  Think about it.  When God invented lemons did he do so because he thought humans would have no problem peeling a lemon and sucking the bitter sweet juice STRAIGHT from a lemon?  Or did he create lemons because he knew people would be intelligent enough to mix lemons with water to have ourselves a refreshing drink?  They say you should never assume (and that includes Gods) so I don't know WHAT to think.What I DO know is that lemonade exists and I can't believe how happy I am about it.  Just a few seconds ago I was drinking lemonade and feeling satisfied.What we have here is a lemonade maker thing.  You should just ignore products like this.  It's just ANOTHER thing to put SOMEWHERE in your kitchen, so when you need something important you have to push this lemonade maker to the side.  Just another thing in the way.  That is SO annoying.  The less stuff in your kitchen, the easier it will be to find important things.What I'm trying to say is that you can make your own lemonade by using your imagination.  The best way to make lemonade is to take masking tape and a butcher knife, and then tape the knife to the middle of a cereal bowl (with the sharp end of the knife standing straight up).  Take a lemon (it doesn't matter if you peel it or not) and keep twisting the lemon on top of the knife, and as you continue doing this, the lemon juice will drip into the bowl.  Just be careful not to cut yourself.  Twist with caution.  If you don't take your time lemon juice will squirt all over the place, including in your eye (and you know how much that stings).Then, when all the juice has left the lemon, pour the lemon juice from inside the bowl into a glass.  Then pour a cup of water in the glass.  Stir, and drink.  Very nice.  Very simple, too.  I just saved you some money.",5.0,lemonade for everyone,1150761600,"06 20, 2006"

That means it works as both measuring cup AND little mixing bowl! So imagine you adding a bunch of liquid ingredients. In a normal measuring cup, you don't want to make it too full because then you can't stir easily without spilling. With this one, you can mix up two cups worth of marinade and still stir comfortably! That's why it's the best!I bought one from my local store, loved it, went back to buy more, and they don't sell them anymore! So I have to special order them from online. What I'm saying is, if you do a lot of cooking from scratch, this is your dream measuring cup!If you only do occasional cooking, then I don't see that much benefit. This cup does take more space in the cupboard because it opens up so wide.

I also use one of those stovetop espresso makers.Now, I am a devotee of the AeroPress. It takes about 90 seconds to heat the water to 175 degrees (the recommended temperature) in my microwave, and another 30 seconds to produce the coffee in the AeroPress (I then add some more hot water to make it more like ""American"" coffee). I do not find it difficult to press down the plunger (I am 55 years old), and cleaning up is a breeze. I roasted some Kona coffee yesterday, ground it to a `medium' texture, and the result in the AeroPress was close to perfection.True, you use quite a bit of coffee (the scoop they supply is quite large, and they recommend two scoops for one cup) but since I buy green coffee beans in bulk the cost is not that much.Anyway, you can get a great cup of coffee in two minutes.",5.0,As Good as Advertised,1269388800,"03 24, 2010"

I went online to Amazon to find a juicer that was no expensive and had a fairly good rating. I settled on this one and I'm so happy that I did. Let me tell you ... at my home in Canada I have a 400.00 Omega Vert juicer (Omega VRT350 Heavy Duty Dual-Stage Vertical Single Auger Low Speed Juicer), and to be honest, I like this one even better. This T-fal has a HUGE shoot so you don't have to spend any time cutting up fruit and vegetables into tiny pieces (like you have to for the tiny shoot in the Omega). And another feature that I absolutely love is the foam separator in the juice pitcher. I wish my Omega had that!!!  It is very easy to clean and it looks nice sitting on the counter. I have nothing bad to say about it at all. I might even by another one of these for my cabin. It economical enough and of high enough quality to justify buying a 3rd juicer just to have for the odd time we go to the lake.Okay, so I know that maybe some of you will think, well, the Omega Vert is a masticating juicer, blah, blah, blah ... yes, true.

Although, they do provide a few free ones for advertising that may cost a little more to use with the trash can, until you can get some at the local store (Glad Tall 13 Gallon Bags) and I would get them their instead of on Amazon because while convient, the price you can get them in the store is about the same as on Amazon, but with twice as many in the box.  There are lots of good buys too when you buy the bigger boxes, no real need to get the Simple Human Bags, but it was nice to try them.  The Can is really rugged.  Took a nice grapple of the edges to lock the lid into place.  The lock on front works really well too and I really like the step to lift up the lid.  It is the first time I have ever had one like this.  I chose the Moca Colored can.  It was a good choice, others did too, so it was approximately $5.00 more, but I think the color compliments the kitchen better.  I LOVE the Trash Can, and the best part is that it included is a 5 year warranty or the Simple Human Companies PROMISE !  Which guarentees you another new can if ever you should need one.  I look at it like I have invested in a product that if it does faulter, I get double my money back in trash can.  So now the can really only cost $25 which is almost what one in the store would cost, a cheap ole piece of crap,  I'm very pleased with my new trash can, sometimes you need to pay a little more for a decent product and after counting the cost, the bags you can buy in the store, make sure they are the Tall 13 Gallon Trash Bags from Glad, you will be Glad you did, no pun intended.  The bigger the box, the greater the saving on bags, has a lock to keep animals like Tapers out, Amber's Cat reviewed left on the Black Can although she bought her's through the company so she could get a Christmas Card with her's for her cat after assisting the Thanksgiving Turkey out to the livingroom likely to watch some TV and have a few chicken wings ;-)  The bones left on the floor did the cat in.  I think Tapers must have been a male cat ???  Keeps kids out of the can.  So softly closes for the midnight raid of the fridge when hungry.  It is nice and sturdy, 5 year warranty, a real Promise I say.  Rest Assure, no one will give you a warranty like that if they don't think their can is up to snuff.  Can't make money giving can's away, can you ?  So I say get the can by all means, make it mocha because I do believe it will show less dirt.  Love my can, something Great besides a Blizzard today.

You fill the kettle with water, plug it in, hit the on button and wait.  It's great for making tea, or using the water for instant noodles.There is no sound to tell you when the water is done, but assuming you are waiting for hot water, you will come back in a few minutes to use it, or else you wouldn't be boiling water.  It's great being cordless as once the water is finished boiling, you can unplug it, remove it from the base and pour it in whatever it is you are using it for.The kettle's handle is the only safe piece to touch once the water is boiled.  Everything else gets hot.  It's light enough for one handed use, but be careful when pouring out the water too fast because the steam will scold you.I don't know why everyone wants an off button.  The kettle clearly states ""save energy by only boiling what you will use"".  If you are planning on making a few cups of tea, then boil few cups, use it, and unplug it.  By boiling more water than you need, and having the kettle keep it warm all day does not save energy.It is a kettle designed for single use purpose, and not intended to be plugged in to keep water hot for instant readiness.

So why did I buy a deep dish pan? Versatility. I wanted to be able to make whatever kind of pizza I wanted (plus, my oven is small, so I am limited in space).I've used it three times now, and it's made the crispiest crust I have ever achieved in my home. Any differences in quality and flavor from a pizzeria, are now due to my own relative inexperience with making dough. The first time I used it, I used one of those frozen pizza doughs you find in the super market. It was alright, but the flavor is off from what I like. Second time, last night, I created my own recipe, and not only did it fit the pan better, it tasted a hell of a lot better too.Though it's a non-stick pan, I still sprayed it down with a tiny bit of cooking oil, just to facilitate easy clean up when done. Definitely works. The pizzas I made slid right out of the pan onto my cutting board when I pulled them out of the oven. It was very easy to then wipe down the pan with a sudsy sponge.I highly recommend the pan, and for the cost of one take out pie from a pizzeria, you have the ability to make your own pies, whenever you want, for less money (and about the same amount of time as it takes to order one out).My dough recipe:2 cups All-purpose flour1/4tsp salt1tsp rosemary1tsp oregano1tsp basil3/4 cup lukewarm water with 1/4tsp sugar and 1pkg active dry yeast (allow to sit for 5-6 minutes)Mix flour and spices in bowl of a food processor. Pour in yeast mixture, and pulse till it forms a ball (30-60 seconds). Turn out onto floured surface and knead for 2-3 minutes. Apply flour to your hands if dough is too sticky.

So far, I've made a chocolate cream pie for two and one of my favorites, Cherry Icebox Pie (a luscious, light cheesecake) from my favorite cookbook,The American Gourmet Collection Cookbook: A treasury of favorite foods(sure, I'm prejudiced.

For those who are interested, I've posted my Chocolate Pie for Two recipe on my personal blog; the address is listed in my Amazon Profile.All I had to do was cut each recipe (for 9"" pies) in half with slight adjustments & they both baked up perfectly.Like several reviewers have mentioned, the instructions warn you not to bake in a preheated oven, but we all know it's impossible to bake a pie (and especially pre-bake a crust) without preheating.  So far, I've made both a graham cracker crust and a conventional crust, & the pie pan was not affected in any way. These crusts were baked in a 375 and 450 degree preheated oven for 7-8 minutes with no problems at all.I'm thinking about buying two or three more of these, simply because they would make great dishes for a casserole for 2 or even a chicken pot pie.

A1VQHH85U7PX0,B005JTHQXQ,"MyBeesWax ""A Music Fan""","[2, 3]","The Panasonic ""OptiFlow"" Canister Vacuum Cleaner delivers powerful suction for tackling everything from bare floors and high pile carpets to upholstory with amazing speed and ease. Unlike most vacuum cleaners, this vacuum cleaner does NOT lose suction as the bag fills up (Thanks to Panasonic's ""OptiFlow"" technology).This Panasonic has a few major improvements over my 3-year-old Panasonic ""OptiFlow"" model (MC-CG885). (a) This model comes with the Power Nozzle (main attachment) and 4 attachments (instead of 2 on my old model) to tackle every conceivable vacuuming task. (b) The dust bags are 20% bigger than the ones on older Panasonic models. (c) The telescoping wand makes the length of the wand adjustible.The Power Nozzle has a motorized agitator (AKA beater brush) that provides plenty of torque to quickly dislodge any deeply embedded dirt or pet hair. The 4 other attachments consist of 3 stored on-board the vacuum cleaner, and 1 stored in a caddie that attaches to the wand.The 3 on-board attachments are:(1) Combo Brush (for furniture, upholstery, drapes, stairs, and walls)(2) Crevice Tool (for furniture, upholstery, cushions, drapes, stairs, and walls)(3) floor brush (for stairs, upholstery, bare floors, and walls)The attachment stored in a caddie is an Air Turbine (for furniture, upholstery, stairs, and more). It has an agitator that quickly dislodges any embedded dirt or pet hair.Other Features------------- Lengthy Power CordThe length of the retractable power cord is 24 feet, so it provides PLENTY of slack for even the largest rooms. It can be quickly retracted by pressing a bar.- 4 Adjustible HeightsThe height of the floor/carpet cleaning attachment can be adjusted for vacuuming bare floor and low pile to high pile carpets. There are 4 height settings: XLO, LO, MED, HI.- HEPA Air FilterAHepa Filter (MC-V199H)on this vac traps the dust particles (up to 0.3 microns) to prevent them from being released back into the air. The Hepa Filter has to be replaced periodically.- Economical Dust BagsEachDust Bag (MC-V150M)can hold a lot. The bags on this model have been re-designed to hold more dirt than the bags on older Panasonic models. A 3-pack is very economically priced.Ergonomics----------- The Power Switch/Slider has 3 modes: Off, Floor, Carpet. It is conveniently located on the handle and is designed to be operated with the thumb of the hand holding the handle of the unit. This makes it possible to maneuver the wand while freeing up your other hand to reposition the cannister when needed.Conclusion----------The Panasonic ""OptiFlow"" Canister Vacuum Cleaner (MC-CG917) is very well-designed and constructed. It is one powerful vacuum cleaner that both easy to use *and* maintain. Given how durable my previous Panasonic ""OptiFlow"" vacuum is (3 years+ and counting), I'm confident this one will last you for many years to come. *HIGHLY* recommended.",5.0,Maintains Suction As Bag Fills Up,1331424000,"03 11, 2012"

Often I avoid cooking rice because it doesn't come out well, or I don't have time. With the timer and delicious rice this makes, I eat rice much more often now. I'm so happy I purchased this, and I kick myself for not having bought this years ago. After my cast iron skillet, this is my favorite kitchen tool.For the first 12 years of my adult life, I ate rice either made in 1) a pot or 2) a cheap rice cooker from Target. Brown rice always turned out poorly, or rice burned on the bottom, and I just thought this was how it was.Finally, I purchased this based on reviews good reviews. This is totally worth it! My regret is not buying this 10 years ago. Brown rice made in this is incredible, seriously, I actually enjoy eating brown rice now. Rice usually comes out slightly sticky, so I can ball it up and dip in sauce, or easily eat without it falling all over. I've only had rice like this cooked in restaurants, never at home. I thought they  had a special trick not available to me, I think they were just using this.Not a single piece of rice has burned yet, and it's cooked the same throughout. I've been using this for weeks, and I can't find a single fault. Rice is my main food, so it warranted purchasing this.I like the features of selecting which type of rice (I use white, brown, and porridge), a timer setting (so rice will be ready when you get home or fermented steel cut oats ready in the morning), and there is a line inside the pot so you can add water up to a line depending on how many cups of rice you added.I'm super cheap, but after using this, I have no guilt about the cost. Now I eat delicious rice and steel cut oats everyday. I might consider this the best kitchen gadget I've ever owned.

A1FXY0GUFHEI59,B004RDOUF2,reg,"[2, 2]","I have been seeking the perfect vacuum for years.  I am picky about what I want and every one I have tried falls short in some way.  I have mostly laminate and tile, but I also have some area rugs, so I want something that will go easily from one to the other.  This one has the controls on the handle to stop or start the beater bar making that easy to accomplish as well as a control for the suction.  I also want a vacuum that will go from regular vacuuming to using just the wand easily.  Dyson was not the one to do that!  I also have a Panasonic canister that I thought would allow that, but it was so hard to separate the wand from the power nozzle (as it is called on the Hoover) that I would have to wait until my son came over to do it for me.  That was one of the first things I checked out on the Hoover.  There are no buttons to push and there is a release pedal on the power nozzle that you step on to separate it from the wand.  You don't even have to bend over.  You do have to bend over to put them back together, but it is so easy to do so.  Now I can get those cobwebs on the ceiling or dead bugs in the corner and easily go back to vacuuming the floor. I would compare this vacuum to an upright vacuum, not a small, portable one.  The head is quite large and will not fit into small spaces, but it will cover more floor area as an upright would.  I wouldn't use an upright to clean out a car, and I wouldn't use this one, either.  When I compare this one to the Dyson I own, this one is easier to use the hose either alone or with the duster or crevice attachments than the Dyson is.As an extra plus, but not necessarily a deal breaker, this vacuum is bagless.  The canister is easy to separate and clean out.  There is a lifetime filter, which is nice, as well as a lifetime HEPA exhaust filter.  Looks like the only thing that might need replacing at any point are the brush and belt.  I am also happy that the dusting brush and crevice attachments store on the handle and I don't think they will fall off very easily.  I love having a retracting cord.  It's a small thing, but it makes me happy.One little bitty thing I found was a misprint in the instructions (yes, there are people who read them).  On page 6, at the top, there is a picture of the hose/hand grip/wand/accessories and a list of the different parts.  The numbers don't match.  The description goes from 12 - 19 and the picture goes from 15 - 22.  There is an easy fix.  Add 3 to the description numbers or subtract 3 from the picture and they match correctly.  The instruction book also states that there is a 2 year limited warranty.I look forward to not checking out vacuums any more.

They have lovely large and deep scalloped sides which make the cupcakes or muffins look delightful when popped out of the baking pan. These are cute served with either end up. If you're glazing or serving with a sauce, the smaller end up (bottom) looks great, and if you're frosting them with swirls of fluffy frosting, then serve them in the more traditional manner.I find I need to turn the oven heat down about 25 degrees when cooking in silicone, I bake them on a cookie sheet spaced a few inches apart, and it's important to let the baked items cool in the pans. They will be too tender and soft to come out in one piece if you try to remove them while they are still hot.Brush with melted butter or spritz with non-stick spray for the first use, and it won't be necessary after that.

AVEKXMND3UYAZ,B0018I8PL4,KitchenGadgets-aholic,"[8, 8]","... I stumbled across this one at Sur la Table.  It fits my hands perfectly and allows for a very comfortable grip due to the curved handle.  I like that the peeler is stabilized at both ends due to the handle extension and additionally has the sharp top edge for removing bad parts of the vegetable.  The sharp peeling edge also has more support behind it, thereby making short work of a tricky potato eye.For many years, I used an old fashioned simple and cheap all-metal peeler.  It wasn't the most comfortable to grip for long periods of time, but it was by far the best functioning peeler.  Unfortunately since it was rusting, it needed to finally be replaced.After trying three other peelers including ones by Cuisenart and KitchenAid, I found not all peelers are created equal.  With many, I was struggling just to peel on tougher skins like sweet potato, mostly because only one side of the peeler was reinforced with the handle.  The Zyliss is reinforced on both ends and removes every peel I've attempted smoothly and cleanly.  We still have our KitchenAid peeler, but Zyliss is my go-to.  It is extremely sturdy, comfortable to use and the best functioning peeler I've used to date.To keep the blades sharp, I always hand wash!UPDATE: 12/8/11 -->  This peeler is still working wonders and has not dulled a bit.  :-)",5.0,After searching for a good solid peeler for years...,1290729600,"11 26, 2010"

This scale requires two AAA batteries (included) which were already inserted in the battery compartment found on the unit's underside.This is nice a looking piece of equipment; it highly resembles a smartphone in size, shape and color. Its LCD numbers are good size and easy to read -- especially against the nicely contrasting blue backlight.If you would like to see pictures I took of the unit we received, please navigate to the scale's main sales page and then scroll down to where the ""Most Helpful Customer Reviews"" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the ""Product Images From Customers"" section, and our pictures are there. Nice looking, accurate scale.The touchscreen commands are very responsive, requiring only a light touch to turn it on or off, reset the tare weight (in order to get the net weight of items within your bowl), or switch between weight modes. The touchscreen is fairly small so you do need to take your time to ensure that you are touching exactly the command you desire. We tested the scale using fishing weights and also two 10g calibration weights that came with another scale, and had excellent results.Right out of the box the scale was on the marks, weighing the 10G, 20G and 6 oz weights exactly right. This scale measures to the 1/10th gram and it was accurate to that level. Unlike what we read in other comments, we had no issue at all with the opening and closing of the battery compartment door; it is a snug fit, but we just proceeded slowly and all worked well. The tare function worked well too.The scale's documentation notes that there is a 10 year manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this scale gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for a scale of this style and size, for use similar to what I have described above, then we recommend this scale to you.

AU45ISE2M5GB2,B00005M1V0,JBC,"[11, 11]","I've been using the Santos for ~3 weeks now: 2-3 full pots per day with my family over the holidays, and now 1/2 pot per day for just me.  I love it.  The only downside is that I used to be just an occasional coffee drinker, and got a pot just for convenience.  I'm now drinking 3 cups a day 'cause it's so good.What makes this coffee pot different from your traditional drip coffee maker?1) The water never boils.  According to the enclosed video, the water is only heated to 96 (C), 4 (C) shy of boiling.  Although there's turbulent action when all the water is in the top funnel, I believe that's caused by heated air is also being forced up the tube, thereby aerating/mixing the coffee.  [Actually, I don't know if traditional coffee pots boil the water, but I know this one doesn't.]2) The water stays in contact with the grounds longer.  The first water up the tube begins releasing the flavor of the grounds while the rest of the water is being forced up.  Once all the water is forced up (except for a bit to protect the heating element in the base), air comes up and mixes up the whole schmear.  The first water up is probably in contact for 3-4 minutes, the last for &lt;1 minute.3) Nylon filter:  paper filter cones make cleaning out the grounds easier, but at the expense of absorbing a noticable amount of the flavor.  The fine nylon filter in the Santos does a great job of filtering out all but the very, very finest of sediment while absorbing nothing.  Depending on the roast, you may find coffee oils floating in your cup, which you'd never find with a paper filter.  A few seconds using spatula to scrape out the grounds is more than worth it for the difference in flavor.4) Polycarbonate material:  If you've used a drip coffee maker for more than a week, dip a Q-tip in hot vinegar and run it between the ridges in the filter holder.  I bet it will come back brown.  The plastic in most machines holds onto to some of the coffee forever.  You can never get them completely clean, and the flavor of your hundredth pot is therefore worse than the flavor of your first.  The polycarbonate material of the Santos comes completely clean with just a wipe of a(n optionally soapy) sponge.  And it's clear, so you can tell it's clean.  I usually avoid plastic because of the flavor, but this material appears to be both totally inert and practically indestructible.About the only thing I think could be improved on the Santos is the ease of cleaning the bottom coffee pot.  The instructions say not to use running water, presumably to protect the exposed heating element.  I wish they'd have given us a plug to stick over the element so we could really completely rinse the pot.Bottom line: This is a fabulous coffee maker.  But beware: you'll drink more coffee than ever, and you'll have alot more moochers dropping by your place for coffee.",5.0,I now make the best coffee ever,1010275200,"01 6, 2002"

AK3I5SH6IY641,B002Y0483O,"Anatoliy Ryaboshapko ""Dragonfly""","[4, 5]","I usually feel pretty skeptic about cheap little gadgets like this one, but an idea of making doughnuts in a waffle maker - that's just what it is: a doughnut shaped waffle maker, intrigued me to the point that I went through all of the amazon's reviews on this product and forgot about it for about a year. That was until I wandered into the home section of the department store and immediately  noticed a large display of these on sale for $19.99. After some hesitation I picked one up, I'm a mother of four after all, of four 5 and under, I have a great market for mini doughnuts right inside my own house, plus my husband owns 30(+/-)  sweet teeth, I figured he won't kill me over this one, so I took this little doughnut factory home. So I came home, I put by baby son for a nap, my girls where at school and I stood there in my kitchen, in the middle of all the mess left from this morning trying to fight my OCD and convince myself to clean and do the dishes first. Well it didn't happen - my curiosity won the battle.  The first step was to study the recipe that was included with the doughnut maker. I must say that I cook and bake since I was a child and know a thing or two about how ingredients work within the recipe and I wasn't convinced that this one will result in a soft, light, stay fresh doughnuts, rather opposite - butter in this recipe and wet/dry ingredients ratio was telling me that these tiny doughnut will come out dense and will stale soon after cooling down. I'm may be wrong - I have never tried this particular recipe, but that was what my cooks intuition was telling me so I decided to modify this recipe to get the best result possible and it definitely paid off - little doughnuts came out soft, light, cakey  and very delicious. I glazed them and sprinkled with some rainbow sprinkles and  my family was very happy about this little sweet surprise. The process of making doughnuts was very simple and effortless, I used wooden screwer to pull these tiny guys out of their nests, it only took 3 minutes for each batch to be cooked. No sticking happened whatsoever, but I did use a little trick that my eastern european grand and grand-grand mothers used to prevent crepes from sticking - rub a little piece of the pork fat on the hot surface just once, before the very first batch. I bet that most of the american people don't just keep pork fat in their fridges, so I'm pretty sure that simple oiling will be enough too.My changes to the original recipe: replace 5 tbsp of butter with 4 tbsp of neutral oil (grape seed, sufflower, etc.) + 1 tbs of soft butter, add 1/2 cup of the buttermilk instead of milk and 1 tsp burbon vanilla extract. Everything else stays the same. Oil will keep prepared doughnuts from staling and the buttermilk will give them lighter texture and a tiny zesty kick.I used Alton Brown's recipe fro the glaze: 1/4 cup milk, 2 cups confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract - mix and heat.Loved making them, loved my family's reaction to them, will make some more tomorrow (with chocolate glaze, I think).",5.0,"Effortless, tasty, fun.

A38V76R24EJSHA,B0045QEPYM,Lee Geiger,"[0, 1]","I have only had it a week,  I found a favorite stainless pan that works wonderfully, So I fixed the handle to it. I tried mac & cheese, the water boils quickly, I spilled some food on the cook top, but it was cold, so it wiped away.I have always appreciated electric frying pans, they hold a lot of food, & they have temperature control, So cooking with this induction over is not much different, because I tell it the temperature, & it always cooks it right. I made a couple eggs so far.I use the @2 setting to toast the bread in the pan with butter, & add ham & cheese & cook the egg, then I put the egg on the bread, . I love the resturant style, because they always taste better that way. I tried the temperature setting, but with eggs & sandwiches, the pan gets too hot, too fast, before the temperature gets regulated, but with larger dishes, I prefer the temperature control better.If the butter burns the bottom black, on the carbon steel pan, that is a good quality, that makes the pan slippery, & the eggs won stick. I also tried sausage in the pan, & if you burn the sausage to the pan, just splash about two teaspoons of water in the pan & scrape it a bit with the pancake turner & take out the sausage before it gets too dry again. When you are finished, you can wipe out the pan with a towel, If you wash it with water. You need to dry it with a towel, so it does not rust & add oil & wipe it out with a towel.I have heard many people complain about the fan noise, My hearing is as good as anyone else, & it was very quiet to me, a little fan, much like one in the computer, is all you hear, & is a very quiet wind noise.I did make one mistake, I had a little stainless mixing bowl, I had the burner set on high, took off the big pan & for 3 seconds, I left the stainless mixing bowl on it. I never thought it had time to get hot, but it almost burned me.I think its great, no heat around the pan, only the pan & the food gets hot.If this thing works forever, I will never have a complaint against it.I made some french fries in the carbon steel pan that I just bought, I can tell you that the cooking process of frying, made more noise than the fan did, for a second, I thought the fan was not running, until I turned off the cooking cycle.I made some mac cheese for grandson, but with vegetables & extra cheese, I turned up the heat to #10, to heat the water quickly, when the water boiled, I turned it to 210 degrees, The stove top then goes to its normal #5 setting. This is good,& since water will not get hotter that 212 degrees, but to steam up the house.  I let stove top watch the temperature until it was done.I only enjoy two pans on the stove, the one carbon steel pan for frying, & the stainless for things that could affect the pan seasoning. Cast iron is great, but I dont want to lift them anymore.I tried making popcorn in the carbon steel 12 inch pan with lid, it worked wonderfully, I worried about scratching the stove top surface, but had no problems, a little oil bubbled out of the pan & lubricated the bottom of the pan & it slid so smoothly, & when the pan is at 390 degrees, I believe it is when the e2 error command comes on, telling me that it is done anyway. The 390 degree limit protects the pan & the food, It also happens to me sometimes when I do my stir fries. When it happens, you dont need to cook it any more, it is done.I took a towel & wiped the stove top, & it still looks like new.I could not find a good stainless wok, that would work on the Ductop stove, so I got some two gallon stainless mixing bowls, They heat evenly on the magnetic inductive stove, So now i can make soups & spagetti too.I tried them & they work fine, just remember to use a hot pad to move the pan when cooking in it, a dry folded washcloth will work,they can get as hot as 212 degrees as long as there is food with water in them.Well it has been about 6 months since I bought this tuxtop magnetic induction stove top, almost everyone is using it now, no hot stove, no smelly smoke, the pan gets hot, & it cooks the food. Lately I ran low on food, grandson always like egg ham & cheese sandwiches, but he always leaves the crust. I decided to make pancakes, we have bisquit mix, self rising flour, margarine & eggs, So i took a couple slices of ham & two slices of cheese, chopped them up, & put 1/2 cup bisquick mix, 1/2 cup self rising flour, two eggs, some bacon bits( more flavor) stirred it up & put it in my favorite stainless pan, one that the magnet sticks to. I heat the pan until the butter begins to smoke. I had it on #10 & turn it down to #6 & make pancakes until the mixture is gone. 3 pancakes to each pan (12 inch pan)Grandson loves them, they are nutritious ( don't tell him that) easy & quick.We add a little syrup, He goes wild on sugar, so we are very conservative on that. He loves them, they are a cheap breakfast, & he is not hungry all the time.If you like them, change styles, you can use hamburger, sausage, Try a cheap sausage that is good for you, make hamburger, sprinkle a little sage on your hamburger while cooking it, It does not have as much fat as bacon or sausage & costs nearly half the price.I bought this Tuxtop 3 months ago, it served me well, despite some misuse, be cautious of overheating it. It shows that I did abuse it a bit. The bakelite top is connected to the button display pannel, in case of overheating, the display could slightly separate from the stove top, a leak could cause malfunction,& drip water on the display pannel.I took mine apart, dried up the water, checked for any other damage, then put it together & used JB weld quick a (350 degree epoxy),on the top to seal the leaky crack,to avoid additional malfunction. It still works properly, after time to dry out. I finally epoxied a small ridge in front of the control display, to keep the water out of the controls, it works well since. I make mostly french fries, grilled ham& cheese, stir fries, & popcorn.After a year of owning it, I dont think I could ever be comfortable without it.It is like any computerized appliance , water in the wrong place can cause malfunction. Even though my pans are big enough, moisture still runs over the sides of the pan during the cooking process.I bought a pop up camper, gas cooking can be very hot in a little space, but with the duxtop, all the heat goes into the pan & the food. We cook coffee & vegetables inside, but meats are messy & smokey, so we put a little table outside for the Duxtop under the awning, & cook the meat products there.

I think it will fit with any d&eacute;cor you have.In addition to measuring weight in pounds or kilograms, it also has a feature to display the weight in stones &#8211; a measure used in some European countries.  The display is excellent.  It is very easy to read &#8211; even without glasses &#8211; which I do not normally have when using the scales.There is a new feature &#8211; referred to as tare.  You can step on the scales and once it records your weight, step off and wait for the scale to return to zero, then step back on the scales holding anything that you wish to weigh.  The scale will show the weight of what you were holding.  This is a marvelous feature if you want to keep track of the weight of a baby or pet.  It also is very handy if you want to weigh an object that is not easy to fit on the scales.  The beauty of this feature is that you do not need to subtract your own weight.  The scales performs this automatically.The scale provides digital readouts.  For weight in pounds, the increments is in one tenth of a pound.  I found the scales to be extremely accurate, tested by weighing objects of known weight.The scale uses 3 AAA batteries, which are provided.  It has an auto-shut off that will turn off the display after 10 seconds.  This is to preserve battery life.If you have a baby, pet or anything that you wish to weight periodically but is difficult to fit on a scale, you will really enjoy the tare feature.The scale is very attractive and with the new features will make a great replacement scale.

The lid seals amazingly, it is easier to brace the lid with one hand and twist the inside of it with the other. Once sealed you can actually pick up the pitcher by the lid and the seal will take the weight which to me says it's a good seal.

W/ Gaba setting (3 hrs cooking time), brown rice does come out nicer and softer.Con's- significantly longer cooking time than that of cooking w/ a pot. Cooking w/ a pot, regular rice: 35 min. Sushi rice 15 min. (after the rice is rinsed and sits for an hour). So it may not be an energy efficient option particularly as I also have induction cook top.

It has become my single favorite pan for when I am REALLY cooking (that is, making a curry, soup, or spaghetti rather than just frying a burger).

Well worth the bump from 4 to 5 stars.I do agree the lid could be better, but I have both glass and aluminum lids that fit it fine.  A GREAT pan.!Original:In person this pan looks a bit shallower and wider than it does in the picture.  I like cooking curries / spaghetti sauces etc. that start out with browning onions or meats.  This is far better for that purpose than an open skillet because it is deep enough to catch the spatter.It is easy to modify standard casserole/sauce/curry recipes to go ""waterless"". That just means less water and finishing cooking on very low heat with the lid vent in the sealed position.  This does seem to improve the flavor, and makes the pan a cinch to clean up, as the low heat prevents any sticking.Very thick multi-layer heat retaining base.

A2PQBEWW2Q03V7,B00005B5ZW,Bob Manson,"[31, 31]","The mixer looks bran-spankin' new, not a scratch, dent or weird noise to indicate that it's been refurbished.  The only concern I can see is the 6-month warranty (versus Kitchenaid's full year warranty on a new mixer).  On the other hand, a refurbished mixer *might* even be in better shape than a new one given that it's just been worked on, and presumably has been extensively tested.  In any case, I think it's worth the potential risk.I've always liked and have had good results with KitchenAid's products, and their warranty policy is great. (Admittedly I've never needed to return a product under warranty, but that's a good thing!)One thing that impressed me right away was how solid the tilt lock is.  When it's locked, there's no vertical play in the mixer--it's solidly held down, as if it were one unit.  Yet the lock is very easy to operate, there's no snap or tricky mechanism needed to open and close the lock.  A minor thing, but it's well-designed.It's a &quot;10-speed&quot; mixer, but in reality the speed is continuously variable from a nice slow stir to ultra-whip.  There are indents for the speed lever, but if you want the speed can be set anywhere in-between.  Not a big deal (I kinda doubt if &quot;7.25&quot; is really more important than just &quot;7&quot;), but again it shows some nice design work--and I know I get annoyed with things like &quot;4 is a bit too fast, and 3 is way too slow&quot;.The mixer is solid, heavy, won't be moving anywhere under its own power, and does a great job.

A14XULA608M2V8,B000FOOSIQ,Lurfy's Ma,"[18, 20]","This is just about perfect for what it is intended for - drinking directly from the thermos.The best feature is the very clever top -- easily operated with one hand. It's spring loaded with a yellow release button. Push the button and the top flips open and automatically ""locks"" so it doesn't flip back and bang you in the nose while you are drinking.Under the lid is a drinking spout just short of 3/4"" wide. Personally, I'd prefer it slightly larger and maybe oval in shape, but it's usable for drinking as it is.Take a swig, set it down, and flip the lid closed. It locks shut with a nice positive locking sound and feel. There's a wire clip that you can flip up to secure it shut in case the button accidentally gets pushed, like in a backpack or duffel bag. I never clip it because it's usually sitting on my desk.As far as I can tell, this is truly leak-proof. Mine mostly sits on the desk, but I've tipped it over a few times and I've tried turning it upside down and shaking it. No leaks - even with hot liquids. I've laid it on the seat of the car with no leaks. There are many reviews here from people who have given it pretty rough treatment and no leaks.It's perfect for water and pretty good for tea. I don't drink coffee, so I can't speak to that. I've also used it for soups, but only those that are just broth. I tried the Lipton Cup a Soup Chicken Noodle, but the noodles all got left in the bottom.The entire lid unscrews for filling. The opening is 1 3/8"" wide, which makes filling easy. I usually have hot liquids, so I don't use ice, but I did a test and the ice cubes from my frig drop in easily without having to jam them in.The base is 3.25"" wide. That just fits in my car cup holder, but may be too wide for some. It's made of a rubbery material that is just right for tabletop use. It's won't slide around, but is not overly sticky.The body is just over 3"" wide, which should be easy to grip for all but smallest hands. The overall height just under 10"" - about size of large water bottle. I can easily carry it with one hand. It also has a ring on the side designed for a carabiner-style clip. They even include a fake carabiner, which says (in barely legible letters) ""not for climbing"".This is one of my complaints. Either provide a real carabiner or provide something that doesn't look at all like a carabiner. This thing could get tossed in a bag and later be mistaken for something a lot stronger. It's make of fairly strong plastic (I couldn't break it with my bare hands), but there is no way it would hold the weight of even a child.This is a HYDRATION bottle - not a standard thermos. It is designed so you can drink directly from the spout - not for pouring into a cup. I didn't quite understand that at first. This doesn't matter much with cold drinks, but if you fill it with a scalding liquid, you could burn yourself badly. It comes with plenty of warnings, but I bet someone will still scald themselves. One reviewer has a funny story about burning your mouth, then burning your face, then burning the rest of you, then throwing the thing across the room spewing scalding liquid everywhere and breaking the china cabinet. That could happen, so be careful with hot liquids. That said, it's great for hot liquids. I only use it for hot liquids. I did get it too hot a few times, but with a little care, it works great.This is a stainless steel thermos - not glass. I always heard that glass thermoses work better. This one seems to work just fine and there's no glass to break.My main reason for buying this thermos was for the hot water that is a big part of my diabetes-prevention diet. I am required to drink at least 64 oz of water every day. I am required to drink at least 8 oz before I can eat anything. I have found that hot water with a little lemon works better than cold. I had been using water from the hot water tap or the instant hot. The instant hot is too hot and I almost scalded myself. The hot water tap wastes water getting it hot and there are concerns about drinking from the water heater.My solution is the Pino Digital Kettle plus this thermos.SeePINO Digital Kettle ProThe Pino allows me to heat water to any temperature from 104 to boiling. I like my drinking water at about 135. The Pino can heat 22 oz to 135 about as fast as I can get it from the hot water tap and it's the right temperature. Plus, it holds it at that temperature if I happen to go into the other room.My only complaints are minor.1. The capacity is not shown anywhere. They have a modernistic logo (Thermos E5) on the front. Would it be screw up the design to put ""22 oz 650 ml"" just below that or on the back side? Makes me crazy. They managed to stamp ""Dishwasher safe"" and "" Do not microwave"" (duh) on the bottom. This a pet peeve with Thermos. They tend not to put the capacity on their products.2. I already mentioned the fake carabiner above.There is one little ""feature"" that I cannot figure out. On the inside of the lid, there's a white plastic seal that fits snugly over the spout. For some reason, they made a little hole in the lid where a small nub or nipple protrudes slightly. At first. I thought it might turn a different color to indicate hot liquids, but I put scalding water in and it did not change colors. I guess it's just a place to snap the seal in place or pop it out for replacement.Anyway, this is a great product. Easily 5 stars. Very well designed.

A3PE884TA8529G,B00JQMAEYK,J. E. Nelson,"[1, 1]","This is one of those rare products that I really have nothing bad to say about.  If you are looking for a small table to use in bed or while sitting upright in a couch or large chair, this is definitely one to consider.The area of the table is roughly about the same size as a TV tray (for those old enough to remember), maybe even a bit larger.  The surface of the table is actually 2 pieces, a solid piece which is about 1/3rd of the table and a hinged piece which is about 2/3rds of the table area.The hinged area folds up and has a metal bar in the back to hold it in place at 1 of 6 possible positions.  There are two holes drilled in the bottom of the table, to which a removable strip of wood can be inserted.  In the event you are using a laptop or book while that portion of the table is in the tilted position, the item will not slide off.  When this portion of the table is not elevated, it is held into the closed position by a magnet.The legs of the table fold underneath the table for easy storage.  The legs on each side can be adjusted which helps keep the tray level.  We found this an awesome feature when trying to serve breakfast in bed.  You can adjust one side higher than the other to make the table level and account for the person lying in bed slightly compressing the mattress on one side more than the other.There is a small drawer on the right side, which I use for storing the wooden strip when not in use.  The drawer can stick a little bit at times.  The drawer is not very big.  With the wooden piece in there, I can fit a few pens and a pack of Post-its if needed.Overall, I think this is an excellent product.  It is sturdy and well built.  The little drawer to store the removable wooden strip was a great idea to prevent the end user from losing it.  Whether it is for using a laptop in bed, serving someone breakfast in bed, or to work on a craft while sitting in a recliner, this table is versatile and an awesome design.",5.0,Awesome Design!,1403654400,"06 25, 2014"

Unfortunately, they shed a ton. I was unsatisfied with many pet hair removal tools on the market and settled for costly lint rollers (I would use at least two rollers per week). This product arrived today and I immediately took to my couch, recliner, bed and rugs to see how well it performed. I have to say for the $25 price tag I paid for this, it is amazing.It will take a couple go-overs to completely remove hair from heavily trafficked pet areas, but I don't think I spent more than 5 or 10 minutes cleaning off a particular piece of hairy furniture.  It's powerful and I did not find the side blowers that a few others have complained about to be an issue.  My Maine Coon cat loves to leave clumps of hair everywhere and this handled them perfectly. I was happy to see the rubber tip option, which made fabric clean-up simple.I was concerned with this product overheating with the amount of hair I was sucking up, but after 20-30 minutes of consecutive use it stayed cool to the touch.

Another stated drawback was that there is no feature alerting you when the coffee is done. However, the brewing takes about 6 minutes and you know the coffee is ready when the basket no longer drips; it's a real non-issue for me. It is lacking what for me would be a nice feature; a programmable start so that my coffee would be ready automatically as soon as I arise.  But as an inexpensive basic 5 cup coffee maker, this one can't be beat.I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:Beware!

The white of this platter goes well with almost any design or color dishes or serving pieces, is safe in microwave ( although this one is too large to fit in mine ) or washed in dishwasher. It is not recommended that it be used in the oven nor on the stovetop, and should not be too quickly brought from ice cold ( freezer temp ) to hot, as shattering may occur as with any glass type product.

A quick once-over extracted a lot of fine dust that was not removed by my older dyson ball. You can easily make a mess emptying the canister, but as a recovering Dyson owner I'm used to that. :)Right out of the box it's great on hard floors. There's enough suction to clean carpets really well--if only the head worked on carpets. It almost does. It will glide properly on one push and I would get my hopes up. Then it would stick hard on the next stroke. Frustrating. The vacuum uses a standard 1.25"" compression fitting, though, so I am looking for aftermarket carpet cleaning heads.So, it is great on hard floors, but not really good for carpet without additional accessories. (However, good for carpeted stairs as is.) Great suction. Really good for the price.[update]Some thoughts after a few weeks of use:I find that if you leave the brushes down in the ""hard floor"" position, it doesn't stick to carpet as badly. It's still not great but whatever.The big ""wheels"" on the back don't really turn. But it's light enough that I didn't notice at first, so I guess it's not that important. They're supposed to, they just don't work very well.This vacuum REALLY moves a lot of air. Great for cleaning windows etc. Great on entry mats, hard floors, and stairs. Still looking for a decent carpet attachment. :)I can really recommend it.[update dec 2013]Recently detailed my car. Good suction, but man is that crevasse brush loud! That's a lot of air.

A23ZNGL704AW7O,B005GYUN9S,Jennifer Ray,"[1, 1]","I love to cook and after years of cooking with cheap pots and pans, I finally began investing in quality cookware. I bought some great pots and pans a few years ago on sale at Amazon. Those have been really great, but I have one complaint - if you put them in the dishwasher, it invalidates the Kitchen Aid warranty. I confess, there are times I really just want to be able to stick all the dishes in the dishwasher.When I saw the Earth Pan II Nonstick Sandflow Cookware set, I was intrigued. Not only did the product description say they were dishwasher safe, but it claimed they were better for the environment. Quote, ""Earth Pan+ features exclusive SandFlow nonstick, which originates from sand and is made without PTFE or PFOA. The unique coating doesn't peel, blister or release toxic fumes at high temperatures. Plus, its manufacturing process produces less CO2.""I honestly don't know for sure whether or not these pots and pans release toxic fumes and I really don't know how any normal consumer could actually test that. Like the claims that the manufacturing process produces less CO2 and that the SandFlow nonstick coating is made from sand, one has to just take these claims on faith. I can attest to the fact that while I have been using just these pots and pans as much as possible for the last month, they have not peeled or blistered and the nonstick surface has lived up to its name.I've washed these pans by hands a few times, but usually run them through the dishwasher and they look just as good today as when I first opened the box.The construction of each pot and pan feels solid - very durable. They have a good weight - not so heavy they are hard to handle but not so light they feel flimsy. They heat very well and cook even better on my electric stove.I was very to find this set uses glass lids - I really appreciate being able to peek at a dish while it is cooking without removing the lid, letting heat escape. The glass lids also feel very durable.The handles on the pans and the lids remain cool enough to touch without a potholder when cooking on the stovetop, another feature that is important to me.There is a fairly good variety of sizes in this set. I have no complaint about the pot sizes, but would have liked a nice big fryer in addition to the two pans in the set. However, I wouldn't take points off the rating for this since the product description very clearly states what sizes you will receive in this set.I have three different models of Kitchen Aid pot and pan sets, and the Earth Pan II Nonstick Sandflow Cookware Set stands up to each of my Kitchen Aid sets in terms of cooking, and surpasses them in the cleaning category. All of them wash well by hand, but for me, the dishwasher support  puts the Earth Pan product on top. And I have to say, I like the idea that they might be better for the environment as well.I have to say that after years of using cheap nonstick pots and pans, I cannot say enough about how much better a good set like this work. You can see the difference in both the cooking and the cleaning.As I compared the Earth Pan II set to my Kitchen Aid sets, I thought it might be helpful to link the models that I am comparing Earth Pan to:-KitchenAid Gourmet Essentials Hard Anodized Nonstick 12-Piece Cookware Set-KitchenAid Gourmet Porcelain Enamel Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set, Red-KitchenAid Gourmet Hard Anodized Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set",5.0,Attractive set of pots and pans cooks well and cleans even better,1330300800,"02 27, 2012"

My only complaint is when it arrived, the spray on seasoning was very messy around the handles leading me to first think that the pot was defective.I also have the Faberware 5-Quart dutch oven and like it slightly better, especially since it was less expensive when it was on sale.  The Faberware has a metal knob lid handle which is very easy to grasp, while the Lodge has a welded loop handle.  Since the lid gets very hot, the knob is much easier to grab securely. You sure don't want to drop the lid on your tile floor or expensive stove.  While the welded loop is very durable, the Faberware knob looks sturdy also.  The cast iron on both are equally rough and surprisingly, the seasoning on both are about equally effective.  Since I usually do a lot of fry/grilling in my pot, I have effectively reinforced the seasoning and can't tell any difference.  The thickness of the iron on both pots is also equal.  The Lodge lid has dimples to more evenly disperse moisture caught on the lid but is harder to clean.  Lodge is made in America while Faberware is made in China.I also have an 8-Qt camping dutch oven from Bayou Classic (made in China).  This unseasoned pot has a lot of minor defects in the metal but cooks just fine after 2 rounds of seasoning.  It arrived with a thick coating of wax that was extremely difficult to get off.

Different styles and features give them a personal appeal, and once used to a toaster, it's one of those things you get attached to. This Hamilton Beach unit not only bears a name I grew up with in my family kitchen, many of those little appliances lived on to be passed to following generations. The toaster I had was an old Sunbeam. It made toast for me for ages, even though it wasn't up to toasting bagels or heating croissants or anything fancy. Still, when I pushed down the lever and it refused to stay down and activate the nichrome wire heating elements it made me sad. Like being betrayed by a loved one who missed showing up for an anniversary, I felt betrayed. I started stopping by bars on the way home from work, dabbling with loose women, and even considered a flirtation with becoming a petty criminal. But I decided it might be easier just to send it off to some place where toasters retired, not unlike the family voted on for grandma.I searched and searched, spending long seconds researching the first page returned on an Amazon product search, and lo, found the replacement for grand... I mean my toaster. There it was, fourth row down, second item. It's digital picture beckoned to me, tantalizing me with its sexy shape and come hither nomenclature. On arrival, it took a while to unwrap it, my anticipation rising like the heartbeat of student feeling the hormonal draw of Mrs. Crabtree, my third grade teacher.The toaster is cleverly shaped, taking less space than the old toaster did by virtue of its design. It can sit well back, leaving plenty of counter to work with like for buttering the bread just toasted. It has a number of presets, for bagels both frozen and thawed, and the same for toast --meaning the frozen french toast and waffles produced by the food geniuses at the frozen food farms. It's a pretty quick toaster in contrast to many, and the single but lengthy slot is able to handle almost anything one might want to toast. Unlike most toasters, the actuator doesn't lower the toast. It acts as an on/off switch, but can also be used to lift the toasted item up to within easy reach, no matter its size. When it toasts it shines a bright blue button that can cancel, with a push, the toasting operation unlike old toasters that disliked being interrupted. When it completes its cycle, it beeps twice to signal its completion. I found that it's wise to run the new toaster through a couple of cycles empty --in order to burn off the light residue of manufacturing. (It gave off a burnt plastic smell for half of the first cycle and then stopped emitting the odor, but I gave it a second cycle just to be thorough.)It's now a familiar member of the family and performs quite nicely.

Somehow, Cuisipro managed to improve the design. The bottom bowls (??) out more and seems to provide greater stability than the previous generation. This model still keeps the suction which is great for keeping things stable for younger kids learning to wash their hands.The pump foams up nicely. Since majority of regular liquid soap get wasted while soaping up, this pump will ultimately pay for itself rather quickly. The ratio is about 3.5 to 4 part water to 1 part soap. No one needs this product if they bought foam soap and kept the container. But not only this one nicer, it works well. Also, you can foam your favorite brand of liquid soap, including baby soap - it works for California Baby brand.One caveat: I only know this because I have the other version of this pump. If you let the foamy soap hang around the chromed portion of the dispenser, it will oxidize the chrome painting which will turn green and come off. I expect this one to behave in the same manner. I assume the colored ones are plain plastic, so they might be better options if you're not carefully wiping off any foamy residue. (I realize the chrome provides a classier look, but it oxidizes. There's just science.)Buying liquid soap is already a waste of money due to higher water content, but buying foam soap is even a bigger waste when the water content is even higher. You never have to buy expensive foam soap, only marginally wasteful liquid soap. (Let's be honest - most of us are lazy to grind bar soaps to make our own liquid soap.) Cuisipro even lowered the price since I initially purchased them. This works well and will save money in the long run when you only end up using 1/4 to 2/7 of the soap than you used to.",5.0,Save money on liquid soap. Works great!,1348012800,"09 19, 2012"

Most importantly, it provides for secure footing when taking a shower.It is smaller than I expected. The dimensions are 26 and 7/8 inches long (at the longest point) but only 13 and 7/8 inches wide at the widest point (so, basically a 14 by 27 inch mat, which are the measurements listed on the package itself). That's a good inch narrower than the info in the Amazon listing.I was able to get this at the Amazon Warehouse for a really low price, so I'm keeping it regardless that it is smaller than I expected. Plus, the brown tones (there are several tones in the mat ranging from a light brown to a dark, coffee brown) are a perfect match for my bathroom.Plus, it may work out better than the larger mat that I had. While that was much larger (36 inches long and 17 inches wide) it turned out to be a real pain to keep it from getting moldy, since it covered such a large area of the tub. Since this is smaller, plus has many gaps due to the pebble design, I'm hoping that mold will be kept at bay. At the very least, the mold stains will be less noticeable since this is a dark color.According to the packaging it is machine washable, made of 100% vinyl and made in China. It had a bit of a plasticy smell when I took it out of the box, but the odor dissipated quickly.I'll update this once I've had it in place for a few months with a report on the mold situation. For the moment, it gets a highly recommend from me provided that the smaller size works for your particular situation.>>>Update Dec 2012:  Had this for 8 months and so far zero mold.

Well, this set of 12 from Ozera is the second set of silicone baking cups I have looked at, the first being by Brengs.  Aside from price differences, are there any other noticeable differences?First, Ozera's color choices are a muted pastel, no where as quite eye catching (and perhaps to some, eye wrenching) almost fluorescent colors used by Brengs.  Additionally, Ozera is actually slightly more &#34;floppy&#34; yet a touch heavier than Brengs, weighing in at .29 ounces versus Brengs' .24 ounces.  The weight difference is minute but still actually obvious in the manner of looking at each cup- Ozera is completely opaque whereas Brengs' cups are a touch translucent.  In other words, there is a tad more silicone used in the Ozera cups.Now what does all this mean?  Not much in practical terms aside from personal color desires and perhaps wanting as much silicone for the buck... yeesh, I suddenly feel like a rhinoplasty special.

Sure, using it daily, it's beginning to show a little wear, but not much. I've gone to using a #4 gold plated permanent coffee filter (which fits fine) instead of paper ones. The main reason is better taste, not the so-called #3 issue (see below). I'm thinking seriously about buying another one to keep in the box for when the day comes that this one finally craps out -- It;s THAT good!. Bottom line - Buy this coffee pot!  The following is the  review I left over a year ago:  I've had this coffee maker for a year now and recommend it without hesitation. I'm ""picky"" about coffee pots, and haven't been happy with any I've had for 3 or 4 years. I researched coffee makers for about three months before buying the Zojirushi and I'm extremely happy!  Two things I've seen comments on: The lid on the carafe can sometimes be difficult to loosen. Two solutions: dont' tighten so tight (duh!), or grab a dish towel to give more grip. It really hasn't been an issue for me. The other thing is the so-called #3 coffee filters. (I've never seen a #3 in my life.) #2 filters will work, but may let your coffee grounds wash over & into the coffee. #4 filters stick up a little too high. My solution is really simple - simply use scissors and trim off about a half-inch across the top of the filter. No need to measure - if it's close, it works fine.  This thing brews the best-tasting coffee I've ever made at home.

A3EPHBMU07LZ50,B00HEZ8A6K,Mysterious Reviewer,"[1, 1]","Sorry but I could not resist the play-on-words! Seriously the OXO Good Grips Complete Grate and Slicer Set is an easy-to-use grater that offers several different grater or slicing inserts. You place the insert inside a plastic container and then snap it into place. You then use the included guard to slice or grate your foodstuff.Tonight I used the grating inserts to make Herter's Potato Pancakes. The recipe uses grated potatoes, crushed saltine crackers, eggs and seasonings. The fine grater insert was a bit too fine for the pancakes so I switched to the larger grater insert. One thing I discovered was the guard was a bit wobbly when grating a large piece of raw potato. I carefully grated the potatoes until most of the potato was grated. I then used the guard which worked well when grating smaller portions of potato. You could get around this problem by quarter and grating the potato I guess, but I took a pass on this method.Overall, if you do not have a food processor I would recommend using the OXO Good Grips Complete Grate and Slicer Set. The grater does include various slice or grating disks that can be neatly stored inside a plastic container. Another nifty feature is the 1 or 2 cup markings showing the amount of ingredients you have grated.Note:  I have uploaded two photos showing the Oxo grater and a batch of potato pancakes made using the grater.Recommend.",5.0,Great grater!,1396224000,"03 31, 2014"

One caution: the vac has an interlock that won't let you fully close the door unless you have the bag on correctly; it's in the manual.  Push the bag onto the short pipe until you see the interlock (it's black plastic, at the top of the bag cavity) move.  You have to push the bag on 'till it seats.  THEN you can close the door.  I don't think it's heavy but I don't have stairs; if you do consider a corded hand vac.  Corded picks up MUCH more than cordless.

It was a delight to serve fresh bread!The only draw back is that although hot and fresh,the cheese/onion bread and the banana bread tasted bland,too ""white"". So, on my next batch of bread I plan NOT to usethe Sojirushi recipes but rather other recipes in a bookfor bread makers that I bought separately from Amazon.comIf you do not have a good bread knife,I would purchase that, too.In sum:  I picture myself baking weekly and exploringall kinds of different breads, even pizza dough and pasta!This is a reliable product, convenient to use and store,a very good investment to consider when ""feathering the nest"".Enjoy!",5.0,Excellent Mini Bakery,1233705600,"02 4, 2009"

Now, while I wait, I hang by the gizmo and do a few simple exercises.More? At some point, around it's 10th year of frequent usage, the rubber ring around the water intake thing finally fell apart. With trembling hands I called the manufacturer's Customer Service. What a treat! I am mechanically challenged, and likely, did not express properly what I needed, so got the wrong rings. Called the CS again, and two days later got the correct replacement. No extra charge. What a concept!And BlueG, like its earlier YelloG incarnation, works beautifully. I use it on clay tiles and Pergo (fake wood floor panels). The prep work (dust, hairs) is done by the Roomba, but BlueG cleans, disinfects and for added bonus, leaves me with a non-slippery floor.

A1HDDJMKB2G5KC,B00017LRAO,D. Barker,"[45, 46]","Since most reviews here may leave a person wondering, hopefully this one will help.This blade does what it is supposed to do, in that if you put ice cubes that are not too big (I use cubes from the ice maker in the refrigerator), then this thing will crush the ice very well.  I don't need to add any water to make this happen.  However, if you are looking to be able to make a larger size of crushed ice, then this may not work.  This blade makes a fine crushed ice pretty quickly.  I don't know if you can stop the action in a way to control how big you want the ice.  I also don't know how much ice you can put into the blender and get a good consistency.  I didn't put in a whole lot since I know blenders don't do well with a lot of product in them of certain types that won't circulate well, such as ice all by itself.To the complaints about the oil:Yes there is oil on the blades when you get this.  It's better than rust, which is what you would get if they were stored after manufacturing without the oil.  Do you think these blades are manufactured on a regular basis?  These aren't stock blades for the blender.  Don't blame some middle man, such as whoever you are buying it from for not cleaning the product before shipping it.

A2RDT9X2TD7Q42,B00006JKZN,T. Call,"[6, 6]","I had a waffle iron in the pantry for decades and every once in a while I'd drag it out thinking I could finally get it to work properly without having the things stick and fall apart. A month ago I tried yet again and ended up tossing the thing right into the trash.Found this amazing waffle iron on another site and since we had a lot of ""bonus points"" I decided to order it after reading the reviews both here and on the other site.To paraphrase MLK, ""At last, at last, thank God almighty"", I can finally make GREAT waffles. I carefully read and followed the instruction manual and recipe. I absolutely will not waste my good money by buying cooking ""sprays"" since I always have a good variety of oils and a couple of silicon basting brushes (bless whoever invented those). I seasoned the baking plates with vegetable oil prior to using, poured in the PROPER AMOUNT of batter (1/2 cup) and miracle of miracles I had a beautiful waffle right out of the gate. The only thing I added to the recipe was a teaspoon of vanilla extract.After 6 usages I can safely say I've only had 2 dripping incidents when I attempted to ""eyeball"" the amount of batter and absolutely no sticking issues.Yes the hinge seems flimsy however all you're doing is opening and closing the plates so that's a non-issue for me. There is no need to press down on the cover in order to bake the waffles. I upped the anti on the heat going to number 4 because I like a darker, more crispy waffle and still no sticking. The batter can sit in the fridge for days as long as it's covered and the flavor remains and may even get better after a couple days. I'd like to cut down on the oil in the batter so we'll see how that goes as far as the nonstick factor but I anticipate no major issues with it. We're no doing waffles instead of toast with butter in the mornings so it really balances out in any event.My next splurge is going to be some expensive but no doubt rewarding real maple syrup. We're using less syrup now than we did on pancakes in any event.The speed of making a waffle was simply amazing (a benefit over Belgian) and the reheat time to make a second one was very fast as well. Cleaning isn't a bit of an issue since nothing is sticking and even the overruns were wiped up easily and quickly. Yes the top of this thing gets HOT but common sense (something too often missing in todays world) tells us to keep our hands off.Frankly I don't believe the reviews that spoke of sticking unless they failed to follow the instructions. The temp controller isn't something you're going to be changing that often unless you've got very picky eaters so that isn't an issue for most users. The hinge is just a hinge and unless you're going to wrestle with it for some unknown reason I simply don't see that as an issue either. It opens and closes simply and easily and I have a feeling it is designed to be able to move as the waffle rises.Overall this is a nice simple product that does exactly what it says it will. Save your receipt since it has a THREE YEAR warranty. For some $8 a year I certainly wouldn't get upset if I had to replace it after three years. Chances are it's going to last me till they haul my body out. Enjoy your great waffles with this machine.",5.0,"Never made decent waffles, until NOW!",1322956800,"12 4, 2011"

No way was this thing going to do what it promised. The two things I took exception to were people calling the resultant brew ""espresso"" (note: it ain't) and the instructions to brew at 180 or whatever. Coffee science defies these notions. You suckers bought into somebody's snake oil claims...or so I though. Well, I decided to pick one up based solely on the fact that I wanted to try a new Able Brewing product (the Disk Fine) cuz they are a cool, local company. Well, I have to admit, this thing does make a good cup. It doesn't make espresso, and it works best when you use properly heated water. What I'm really enjoying about it is that it allows me to experiment and continue on my everlasting quest of coffee geekery and tinkering. There are tons of ways you can brew with the Aeropress, and that's pretty much a coffee geek's dream. I can use the Disk or the included paper filter. I can brew traditionally or inverted. I can use a finer grind with a shorter steep or a courser grind with more contact time. I can press fast or slow. I can play with water:bean ratios. I can mix up all of these things and experiment and play and geek out. I like that. I also like how quickly I can brew and clean up. This isn't going to replace my Chemex or V60 or Eva Solo or siphon or Kone or anything, nor did I want it too as I enjoy the differences inherent in all brew methods. It also hasn't produced anything that'll keep me from going to the shop for an espresso. It will, however, allow me to enjoy the process of brewing and drinking coffee at what is probably the cheapest entry price for any manual coffee method. I couldn't really ask for much more.

The flask is perfectly nice and functional. The size makes it practical to lift the spirits of more than one drinker at a time, but it certainly is not ungainly. Height is 5 1/4"", width is 3 3/4"", thickness is 7/8"", add 3/4"" to the height for the cap. It is made of stainless steel of appropriate thickness, as far as looks and feel are concerned. It appears sturdy enough, and does not flex upon normal finger pressure. It has a nice brushed exterior on the sides, with polished top, bottom and cap. The cap holder is aligned perfectly fine and the cap twists on with ease. All of the edges are ground smooth, so no chance of cutting lips, hands, etc. on anything. This is as nice as it gets for what is admittedly a pretty plain item.Since a lot of reviewers complained about leaks, after washing it thoroughly I filled it with water completely and let it sit on the counter lying down. It did not leak a single drop after several hours. I drank some of the water when I finally emptied it and it had no off flavors whatsoever. The instructions that came with it clearly state that one should not store fruit juices or other acidic liquids, that nothing should be kept in the flask for longer than 3 days, and that the flask is not dishwasher safe.The funnel is a separate item that does not come in the same box with the flask, and is not made by the same company as far as I can tell. It has a decidedly rougher finish, and there is an edge around the rim that is somewhat sharp. Still nothing horrific, but a more basic item. However, one does not carry that around, so for the few minutes while filling up the flask it is perfectly acceptable.I believe the reason why this things gets so many bad reviews is that several vendors are selling a rather generic item, and since there is no maker or model indicated, some of these products are made to much lower standards by different manufacturers.

The covers help keep the food fresh for future use.  One note of caution: each matching cover must be snapped into place all around the bowl's rim in order to maintain an air-tight closure and prevent air from coming in, which can spoil the food.  This must be done carefully and checked before placing into the refrigerator or freezer.  When removing food from a bowl and then returning it to the refrigerator, the same caution must be exercised in order to maintain the contents' freshness.  I had a couple of occasions, that the rim was not completely sealed, and the food spoiled within a few days.  I have found that I have saved money, over the plastic, disposable food storage containers.  Once they develop an odor of fish, especially, or get oily from the food contents, they are very hard to clean and reuse.  That is when they must be disposed of.

A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,B000UVHUCU,D. Alexander,"[10, 12]","This is a lovely mixer almost identical to the Classic Plus, except red and slightly more powerful. I bought the latter to make cookies after my hand mixer started to smoke during a particularly intense doughing session. I used it primarily for that and pizza crusts. Things that could be mixed with a handheld whisk, I opt for that instead.Do you need a stand mixer? No, probably not, but it sure takes the grunt work out of stirring and kneading. It also mixes more consistently than I could by hand and classes up the counter.If you're set on a stand mixer, should you buy this one? Maybe. It's not designed for huge amounts of heavy dough or constant use. It's built well, but it's not an industrial machine. It audibly strains and thumps with a double helping of cookie dough (around 25 oz of flour) and while kneading wet, thick pizza dough. With that sort of load, there's no speed difference between setting 6 and 10, though of course you'd only knead at setting 2 anyway.KitchenAid has some mixers that are ostensibly a bit stronger. They're all lift-style: instead of tilting the head back, the head sits higher and you raise and lower the bowl. I prefer the tilt-head style. The paddles never get out of the way with the bowl-lift, getting the bowl to lock in place is a jerky movement, and it takes up a lot of vertical counter space. What you do get for the extra cost of the Pro series is a better dough hook, a metal gearbox, more power, and a slightly larger bowl. Even these higher-power mixers will fall short of alternatives from Bosch and Electrolux for serious breadmaking, however.If you opt for the Artisan, you gain 1/2 QT of bowl capacity, a handle on the bowl, the splash guard, and color choices besides white. Otherwise, it's functionally identical to this model and about the same power. The splash guard in particular is a fiddly thing, you spill less just tilting the mixer up and dumping your ingredients in. I do think the larger bowl and the handle are worth something though (especially for double recipes), so the Artisan may be preferable for more than just the color.There's a lot of talk about Hobart units. Prior to about 1985, these mixers were made by Hobart, a supplier of industrial kitchen equipment. Later models are made by Whirlpool. There's some debate whether the new models are as good as the old ones, particularly in regard to the gearbox. My take is that if you can find an old Hobart (e.g., K4SS, K5-A, K5SS with a metal 'Hobart' placard) and it runs well, it's likely to keep running well no matter what you throw at it. But it won't be as clean and may not fit certain new bowls, paddles, or attachments.New or old, these KitchenAid mixers are dead-simple to repair. The motor brushes are replaceable without dismantling the unit ($10 or so and hidden beneath the black circular covers), the speed governor is mechanically adjustable, and the gearbox is straightforward and easily accessible. This means that they're intriguing on the used market. People receive them as gifts and put them in the local classifieds with minimal use or minor flaws you can fix. Typical transaction prices are $125-$150, and I've seen this mixer as low as $75. For new units, Kohls has them on sale quite often.Here's the full list of KA mixers:K45SS - Classic* Tilt-head, 250W, 4.5QT metalKSM75 - Classic Plus* Tilt-head, 275W, 4.5QT metalKSM95 - Ultra Power* Tilt-head, 300W, 4.5QT metalKSM100 - Ultra Power Plus* Tilt-head, 300W, 4.5QT metal handle, pouring shieldKSM150 - Artistan* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shieldKSM152 - Custom Metallic* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handle, pouring shieldKSM155 - Premium Metallic* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handle, pouring shieldKSM160 - Ultra Power* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT glass handle, 3QT metal, pouring shieldKSM160APS - Architect* Tilt-head, 325W, 5QT metal handle, 3QT metal, pouring shieldKSM500 - Pro 500* Bowl-lift, 325W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffRKG25H0X - Heavy Duty* Bowl-lift, 450W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKV25G0X - Pro 5* Bowl-life, 450W, 5QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKP26M1X - Pro 600* Bowl-lift, 575W, 6QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto shutoffKSM7586P - Pro Line* Bowl-lift, 1.3HP, 7QT metal handle, pouring shield, spiral hook, metal gears, soft-start/auto-shutoffIf you'd rather have a more powerful bowl lift mixer, KitchenAid's refurbished store often has the Heavy Duty Series for as little as $175 (if you Google a coupon code).

A209QRVZ99UQDC,B0055FR4DQ,Calamity Jane,"[50, 50]","This frame is very, very strong and easy to use. It has a vast expandable range that works nicely with a thick pillow-top mattress, something shorter frames don't do. I have a pillow-top, yet I only had to expand the frame halfway up to make plenty of room for my size 8 feet. Even the largest feet will have plenty of open space because the frame expands up to 31-inches. Even when fully expanded it does not bend or wobble.I was concerned that this frame might not be wide enough, but it is perfect. It creates a comfortable ""cave"" for my feet, both in height, width and depth. It holds the weight of my two blankets, one of which is heavy wool. The frame could hold three times that much weight.You can lower the frame during the day and raise it up again before going to bed, but doing so extremely difficult. It's almost impossible to push both buttons in at the same time and raise or lower the frame. I simply keep the frame up all the time. It's not a big deal for me, but it may be for you.The other drawback I found was that the blankets slipped off the frame during the night, exposing my feet. That's because the blankets slide across the top of the metal frame. I solved that problem by wrapping some inexpensive non-slip rubber matting around the top bar. I wrapped duct tape around the ends to keep the rubber in place. The blankets don't move now.Despite the few drawbacks, I'm giving this product five stars. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is keeping the blankets off my feet.***UPDATE*** To give you a better idea of how strong and durable this thing is, my 10-pound cat has taken to sleeping on the ""hammock"" created by the blankets that cover this frame. The rubber matting prevents the blankets from slipping under her weight. The frame easily supports the cats weight.",5.0,Works great!,1328745600,"02 9, 2012"

Made of porous material a cast iron skillet, fryer, or wok will absorb oil and a form a protective coating on its surface. A cast iron skillet is the original non-stick cooking utensil first used over hot coals in a fireplace and then later on a cast iron stove. New sand casting techniques, and the introduction of pre-seasoned cookware, lends itself to the evolvement of the slick cooking surface, and now cast iron cookware may be used on most electric and gas stoves right out of the box.A modern cast iron wok, round with convex sides and a flat bottom, is used for preparing vegetables, seafood, beef, or chicken for your favorite oriental stir fry dish.Most round cast iron skillets are made with a pour spout on each side, and conventional lids will not fit these. A properly made cast iron lid will fit your cast iron skillet tightly, and redirect moisture back into the pan.A good cook can always use an extra lid as some skillets do NOT come with one, would be one of the best reasons. Saying this, I ordered the Lodge 12-Inch Skillet Glass Lids because my 12-Inch skillet did NOT have a lid. Lids are excellent to have especially if they are clear, and I prefer to cover while I cook certain items.Some of the Product Features are:* Glass is tempered for safety* Dishwasher safe* Lid and knob are oven safe to 400 degrees Fahrenheit* Fits standard Lodge 12 inch diameter pansI am very pleased to find lids that make a perfect seal and being tempered glass you can monitor your cooking process. The glass lid is perfect fit you don't have to worry about steam leaking all over the raised handle and with a quick glance you know how far along you are in the cooking process without taking the lid off.The lid is deep enough so you can cook without getting everything all over the lid.  It is easily cleaned in the dishwasher.  The glass is tempered.  You can cook much faster with you have a lid because you catch the steam to aid in cooking.I am very pleased with the purchase of this lid.

If you are packing enough hot food for a man and preheat the containers it will stay hot until lunch or suitably-warm all day.The jar is designed to have (hot) soup in the bottom bowl, (hot, packed) rice above it, and then veggies in the upper containers.  Part of what keeps things hot is (1) preheating with boiling water, and (2), putting large quantities of hot stuff in the containers.This may sound silly, but so many people try to put hot things into a cold container without any regard for heat-transfer.  You've gotta get the container hot.  And for me, I'm packing way less food for a kid so it's extra hard.What I do is, first thing in the morning -- fill the jar with boiling water.  Well, not boiling since I use my keurig's water for this. But I do let it sit in there, preheating, for at least half an hour.  Right before we leave for school I heat super-hot whatever I'm packing into the preheated bowl and straight into the preheated jar.

A2WNXS3CNAQS01,B00006IV33,Sapere Aude,"[184, 189]","Original Review:Note - mattress cover is not as pictured - the one we received had a cute stars and moons pattern on it.  Very adorable, but not pure white as shown.We recently bought a second one of these Aerobeds for our younger child.  We use this whenever we are sleeping away from home - so often we stay with relatives and there aren't enough beds for everyone kids included.  We used to use a typical full size adult air mattress for them, but when you get near the edge of a regular mattress, you tend to roll off and the kids would constantly be falling off.  The dip in this makes it rollproof, and the smaller size is great for being able to tuck them beside a bed or wherever there is space when visiting grandma's house or going on vacation!Blowing it up is quick and easy - the included pump blows the whole thing up in less than a minute.  It rolls back up easily too and stows neatly in the included bag.My kids are 4 and 2, and I'm thinking we can easily use these for many years to come before they will be outgrown.  Heck, I could probably sleep on it, as I sleep curled up on my side.Edited Review 4 years later - I bought these mattresses in 2007, we have used them lots, for camping as well as every time we visit the grandparents.  We tell them not to, but the kids walk over them, jump on them, they still are going strong.  My daughter is now 8, and is over 51"" tall and my son is 6 and is 48"" tall and they both still fit fine in them, since they tend to curl up as they sleep (at this point if they lay completely flat and straight their feet are on the end of the bed.  I have no plans to replace them yet!August 2013 - Back again.

It has been two years and the Pinzon is my ""go to knife"" for most of the kitchen work I do.  It performs perfectly for slicing meats sandwich thin.  The blade has withstood many cuts and remains as sharp today as when originally opened.  I use the steel on it before I begin and after three or four swipes it is ready for whatever I hit it with.  Still a top quality blade for a super good price.At first glance I was underwhelmed but I was wrong by a long shot.  When I opened the meager package my expectations were less than normal.  The knife itself was minimal at best but that was before a closer inspection.  Having all the attributes of an American I did not read the instructions first.  There were none.  But, as it turns out, I needed none.  I checked the blade and handle for defects.  None.  I checked the blade's edge for sharpness.  It was dull or at least I thought so until I used it.After washing it off with sudsy soap (redundant?) and water, rinsing well and drying, I put it to the tests.  I started with a hot turkey breast.  Hot is more difficult to cut thin slices than cold.  This cut the breast with ease and the pieces were quite thin.  I subsequently cut the breast while it was cold and the slices were much thinner than all the other knives I have in my arsenal.  Can one have a knife in an arsenal?In between I cut veggies and they were a snap and completed with ease.  Try it, you'll like it.  Then came the beef.  Slicing a 4 pound rump roast was slick as cutting butter.  Really!  I especially like the thinness of the blade. Unlike many santoku blades this one does not have the little ridges (I know they have names but my memory fades me about the correct name) to assist with the cut material falling off.  Not so with the Kai.  No ridges.  I am glad because none was needed nor necessary.  The small curve at the front of the blade adds to the ability to control cutting whatever.Bottom Line:  Great knife at a great value.",5.0,Slick and Sharp Stainless Steel Santoku Slicer,1265068800,"02 2, 2010"

The spouse suggested that we start hanging our laundry as the dryer uses a large amount of electricity.I went out in search of how to hang up a clothesline, and found this product as frequently purchased together with this clothesline http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y75R0S/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So I gave it a try and ordered two of these along with the clothesline. I actually wasn't sure how it was going to work yet, but I did know that I wanted to hang my laundry between two trees in my backyard that were conveniently 45 feet apart.I have no idea if I used this tool correctly or not, but I ran the line through one of the holes on the end of the tightener, then around a tree branch that's about 10 inches in diameter, then through the hole on the other end of this tightener, then through the center hole, and started winding until I felt enough line was wrapped around the center (about six turns). Then I did the same thing around the other tree, and this time tightened until the line was as straight as I could get it. Then I went back to the first tree and tightened a few more turns until I couldn't turn anymore.So again, I don't know if that's how you're supposed to use this cable tightener, but it has been working marvelously. I fill the line with clothes every weekend and it holds up fine. Last weekend I hung up all my heavy dog blankets and couch covers that were due for washing, and it was very windy. The line held up, the blankets never touched the ground, and the wind didn't cause any problems. The tighteners never loosened or showed any signs of wear. I did have to tighten once after hanging my first load of laundry, but I think that was due to the line stretching and not due to the tighteners. If the lines stretches some more, I think it will be super easy to tighten again.Also of note, there is a lever that you can push on this tightener that will allow you to release the cable if you need to take it down. I mostly keep my clothesline up, but there have been times I needed to take it down because it was in the way. So it was nice to be able to do so, and then easily put it back up.I am very happy with this result, and can't wait to see my reduced electric bill.",5.0,"Works very well, very easy to use",1395964800,"03 28, 2014"

I own three other french press coffee makers, all of which sell for more than this one, one is more than double the selling price of this one, and THIS is the one I'll reach for in the morning.The good bits:- flawless performance with coffee or tea- easy to clean plunger mechanism- stylish appearance- durable construction- good size (34 oz -- I can get 3 cups using my 10oz mugs)The could-be-improved bits:- the manufacturer's recommendation is NOT to wash the carafe in the dishwasher.  I know others have mentioned that they've washed it on the top shelf, and that may work if one is careful.  Not a HUGE negative -- the entire unit cleans up quickly in the sink after use.I tried this out over a 4-day period using a variety of coffees, as well as loose-leaf tea.  I own a burr grinder, and have some experience with adjusting the grind for this type of coffee maker.  I found this one to be a bit more ""forgiving"" in terms of coarseness of grind -- some french presses are VERY particular, and the grind has to be *just*right* or you end up with a real mess.  This one allowed for some leeway, but remember that you do need a coarser grind than for a drip pot.  Tea was no problem at all -- I used a good Prince of Wales blend, a darjeeling, and an Irish Breakfast Tea -- the press did a fantastic job of filtering the leaves when the tea had steeped.  Very nice.Bottom line:  This is a good-performing reasonably priced french press coffee maker that can compete favorably with its more expensive cousins.

A3SUZA0C8QV8AW,B002J4UPM8,"Charles G. ""An Engineer and Business Person""","[3, 3]","I have three of the higher quality Klean Kanteen (KK) bottles, but decided to purchase one of these on sale at a local store to use as a bike bottle.  Klean Kanteen bottles are five times as expensive, so I figured I just wanted something I could beat up and potentially lose without worries and this fit the bill.The difference between the two products is pretty large.  The KK bottles are twice as thick, and are made out of a single piece of stainless steel.  This allows the bottoms of the KK bottles to be rounded at the edges (they are still flat at the bottoms) and not leak because it is a single piece.The Green Canteen (GC) bottles are made from thinner stainless, and the bottom edge is squared off, though it isn't remotely sharp and not ""razor sharp"" as one reviewer mentioned.  The practical effect of the difference between the two bottles is nothing.  I also note that a lot of the KK reviewers say their bottle tops leak, though I don't have this problem with my KK bottles or with this bottle.My GC bottle arrived with an oily, metallic smell that washing with normal dish soap and airing out for several weeks did not get rid of.  It took soaking overnight in automatic dish detergent and scrubbing with a brush to get rid of it.  It still imparts a slightly metallic taste.  I suspect they use a less expensive grade of stainless steel that you can taste or at least smell.  I had no such problems with any of the KK bottles.  I noticed that some KK reviewers mentioned the same problem with their bottles, and that none of the other GC reviewers have mentioned this problem, so it may be something that different people are sensitive to, or it could be that I just got a batch with some leftover polishing chemicals and the KK batches can sometimes have that happen too.Once I got rid of the metallic oily taste, I'd say I got what I paid for - a cheaper bottle that probably won't last forever, which I'm OK with.  If you want a cheaper, less well-built product, buy this one.  If you want something that will last a long time, and uses a higher quality stainless, buy the KK.

Sometimes store clerks in kitchen shops try to talk you out of buying a ceramic knife because they say it will break the first time you cut into a fruit and hit a seed or drop it in the sink, and they say that you can't sharpen ceramic knives yourself etc. But I've dropped mine a few times onto the floor, I've cut into a pumpkin with it (probably won't do that too often though) and after 2 years it hasn't dulled at all.Even with the rounded nose I can still cut the core out of tomatoes and lettuces. The only things I'd suggest to be careful of are staining, bending, and damaging other things. Red beets have stained my nice white knife patchy and brown but it doesn't really bother me and that's the only veggie I've found that stains (and I eat a very wide variety of veggies). Ceramic is brittle so you must be careful not to bend it like you might with a metal knife while struggling with a pumpkin. Because ceramic is harder than glass, you should definitely not cut with a ceramic knife on crockery including corelle ware, otherwise you will cut the crockery as well as the food.One more thing to mention is that this knife is great for cutting bread.

Our leaky Mr. Coffee had finally died, thank God.  As usual, I go online and check reviews to see if I may be returning a product I have not first researched here at Amazon and online.  I had my eye on another B&D; here on Amazon with an audible alarm after brewing is complete, which gets nearly 5 stars across the board.  I was shocked at the negative reviews on this one and expected the worse (and still have my receipt, just in case), but I assume the Lord has blessed my Mom (she is a minister), and thus I.We are having none of the problems being mentioned here, other than the coffee not being extra hot after brewing.  It is fine for me, because I usually drink my coffee slowly and have to reheat it in the microwave a time or two anyway after a few minutes (I use a big cup).  Same with Mom, but she adds cold milk to hers and always has to reheat her coffee, doesn't matter what brand coffeemaker we have.I keep expecting to see leaks from the carafe, but again, I guess the Lord is watching out for Mom.  She appreciates how this one does not leak even a drop when pouring because our old Mr. Coffee always got coffee on her nice white countertops.  I loathed the thing myself from the time I bought it because that has always been a pet peeve of mine, coffee carafes that leak.  Not cool in 2010.All in all, I can safely say we have enjoyed this coffeemaker thus far very much because there are no carafe leaks when pouring a cup of coffee; none when pouring water into the reservoir; it is much, much quieter than our old Mr. Coffee; the largish buttons have a satisfying 'click' to let you know your selection has been recognized when pressed, and the coffee is acceptably hot.  If these things change or it suddenly dies, I'll be glad to let you know.  But with only 4 left, I guess B&D; are tired of the complaints on this one.  They should offer the customers on here and elsewhere with legitimate complaints (not Amazon's shipping, etc) a replacement coffeemaker, it would seem to be the wisest thing to do with such a universally hated product.  Good luck folks, and remember, our Mr. Coffee leaked when new too, we just decided to live with it because it had almost all the same features as this one.  But if it had leaked like some of you seem to indicate, I would have taken it back in a heartbeat.

I installed 6 of the Econo large heaters in that room. We put 2 thermostats in the room (side by side will explain that) and put 3 heaters on each of them. Don't stack the thermostats because they give off some heat and that will prevent the top thermostat from working properly.

My heaters are now going on 9 years old and yes they have some cracks, but they are not a furnace that comes with a twenty-five year guarantee. I figure I have saved so much money using them for the principle source of heat in that room, that when I am ready to paint the room again, I will replace the heaters and still be money ahead.

I have two similar blankets from that national chain that buys ""big lots"" and sells cheap that are great. This one, however, is definitely a higher quality than those, though it is slightly smaller than those.Being microfiber, 100%, means this blanket is devilishly warm. I walked outside last night in 22 degree weather with this wrapped around my torso instead of wearing a winter coat. I would say this kept me as warm or warmer than the coat honestly. This actually replicates my experiences with the other microfiber blankets I have.What this one has, that the others don't, is that this is really soft on both sides, having what looks like a microfiber approximation of sheep hair or something similar.I went with the brown color. Multiple colors are nice to offer, and I'm sure my brown is much warmer than the pink!

Used on your lap or with you curled up underneath it, watching TV or reading, this is perfect for those nasty winter nights.The only thing I didn't like about the blanket was taking it out of the nice plastic bag it comes in, as doing so left little pieces of the microfiber ""hair"" on the floor.

A14HHY1JYDQHBU,B000QRB1GE,Kuzya,"[0, 0]","I spend a lot of time in the kitchen baking and cooking all kinds of goodies so I needed this type of mixer that had a little more oomph to it to get through the thickest of batters and doughs without having to spend a ton of money. I read the reviews on quite a few brands and decided to take a risk on this one. Best case scenario I get a kick butt blender for less than half the cost of a high end one, worst case scenario I wasted a whopping $13.00 on something I was suspecting would not perform like the lamborghini of the hand mixer world.Pros:1) It's not too big and not too small, it's just right for where I store it2) Surprisingly enough for a dirt cheap product is has more than enough power. You can't complain it's not strong enough  after paying $13.00 bucks for it ...I mean you can't really expect a $300.00 performance out of it can you?3) I love that the back end of it has a little 'step' like feature and what this does for me is lets me leave my mixer resting IN the bowl without it slipping or sliding into what I'm mixing or out of the bowl. I can leave it in there and go get something from the fridge or whatever. Who doesn't love hands free?  With the right bowl (rubber bottomed anti-slip bowl) you can leave  your mixer turned on and in the bowl mixing for you while you poke around your cupboards. You are most likely not supposed  to do that but I do it anyways lol.Cons:The only problem with this machine that I have is that the speed switch is also the pressure sensitive whisk release button. Once in a while when in a real rush I press the button down which makes the little mixer blades pop out when I meant to increase the speed. It's such a random far and few between occurrence that it doesn't really bother me all that much.The bottom line...If you want a great hand mixer and a fraction of the cost this is the one to get. It's a hard little worker and doesn't put up much fuss when mixing the thicker doughs. It's been a trooper through mixing banana bread batter, brownie batter, it's been a real trooper through thick cookie doughs, I've mixed pizza dough with it, it's great at mashing/blending/mixing bananas, etc..You just can't go wrong for the money.",5.0,Great machine with an awesome price tag,1360972800,"02 16, 2013"

When I figured out that I could have had my kitchen counters re-done for what I spend at Starbucks in 6 months (!), I knew I had to learn to make my own lattes.I bought this little sweetheart and gave it to the DH for the kids to give me for xmas.  I read all the reviews and the directions, plus looked up Starbucks syrup-pump volumes online.  So I knew there would be no tamper per se (the scoop is the tamper) or pitcher (I just use a ceramic syrup pitcher).  And I knew how much syrup I wanted (see recipe below).First time out, the brew was bitter and the milk was cold.  The directions say that too fine a grind makes a bitter brew (oops), but I knew from the reviews (thanks, reviewers!)that your tamp can compensate for that.  So since my grind is too fine, I tamped very lightly the second time - that fixed that problem.  Also my milk wasn't steamed enough because I hadn't put enough extra water in the reservoir for steaming - the second time I followed the instruction manual amounts for cappuccino, which gave me enough extra water with which to steam my milk.  Problems solved!  Latte was perfect that second time around.My recipe for grande soy caramel latte: Espresso for 2 cups, water for 2 cups cappuccino (manual says 5.5 oz but I know that 6 oz = 3/4 cup so I just throw in 3/4 cup because that's easier...), brew, plus 1/8 cup of syrup (grande = 4 pumps ... at .35 oz per pump, per the SB website, 4 pumps= about 1.5 oz = which is more than 1/8 cup, but I want a little less sugar), plus 4ish oz vanilla soy milk (or milk of choice of course)- steamed.  Put the syrup in your mug first, then the brewed espresso, then pour the steamed soy milk while using a spoon to hold back the foam, then use the spoon to plop the foam on the top.

I have several Global and Henckels knives that I received as gifts a couple of christmases ago, and sadly, as much as I cook and have a variety of kitchen devices at my disposal, I neglected to really maintain the knives themselves and they ended up to the point that they couldn't even adequately slice a ripe tomato.My knives were in pretty bad shape I'll admit. I ended up having to pass the knives about 10-12 times each to really restore them to sharpness unlike the package's recommended 3-4. Nevertheless, they were restored to working order, even the serrated Henckels ones! That has always been the major obstacle to me picking any other sharpener is that most of them don't work well with serrated knives.I can say with certainty that this puppy certainly performs well with Serrated knives just as well as my smooth-blade Global knives. Cleanup is minimal as well, the shavings carved off are minimal and a quick shake of the device will shake out any shavings that remain.What really struck me about the device is how tiny it is! Seriously, this thing can easily fit in any kitchen drawer, even the messy ones! I'd wager it's about the size of a 1-cup Pyrex measuring cup, slightly smaller I'd say.Overall, this is a solid product top to bottom.

ARKQYQ6FMLT3H,B0002T3UJ2,"Neil E Howell ""Howeln""","[208, 210]","I read a lot of the reviews, and bought this anyway, but was unsure.  I figured what they heck, but it was what some of the positive reviews said that made me decide to get it.I'm glad I did.  I just used it, and wow, it was fun (if you like to cook), and easy.  I did mess up a little, which turned out to make a small percentage of mine to not be sealed, but that was user error.  But the main thing here is....I did not have to seal a single ravioli, and they cooked up just fine.Most important things to do;*roll pasta sheets to #3 on the pasta sheet roller....period.*watch the youtube video with peter pasta.  He has two videos, almost that same, but one actually says what settings he is using, which is THREE!!*read the instructions that come with it....twice.Simple huh?  First and foremost, regardless of what recipe one uses and what they say to do, the setting for the pasta sheets is 3, not 5, not 7, not 42, but 3 - why reviewers complained when they set it to 5 or higher, I have no idea.  Peter Pasta video AND the instructions say this is required for the raviolis to seal correctly.  Maybe if you have a special pasta rolling pin, and hand make them, then they can be made thinner, but not for this machine.Now, does this mean the the raviolis will be too thick and maybe doughy....nope.  I think it's because the way the thing works, it stretches the dough a bit in the process.While the unit is hand cranked, it's not that big of a deal.....and I'm not sure I would want it to be powered....it sucks the filling in quick enough as it is.  I'm cooking for two, not 20.  I made 4 dozen ravioli in just minutes...out of the three steps (mix dough, mix filling, roll dough, and making ravioli), making the ravioli was the quickest (even my first time).There will be a bit of wasted dough, as there is the first set to get the dough started and there are three stripes along the length that get torn off (that separate the ravioli length wise).  But, you can just roll it out and use it.  The ravioli just tear apart, but don't try to speed along on the tearing part, or you tear them open a little like I did.So what did I do wrong while operating the machine....well, I decided to make a bit more dough than I needed....then decided to turn it all into one sheet.  My thought, once started in the machine, I would just make one continuous sheet of ravioli...how cool is that!  The #3 sheet was about 5ft long, folded in half and started into the machine, a little over 2ft hanging down the sides.  This made two problems.  The first is that they were just too long to manage without stretching the dough - so i set the ends on the counter to hold the weight.  This, as I found out later, slanted the sheets of dough through the feeder in the beginning, so the first 6 rows of ravioli, did not have dough on the one edge to pinch closed - though it did finish centering quickly enough.  I only lost 6 ravioli out of...what, 4 dozen.This also lead to another issue....which is why the instructions say only a certain amount, pesky instructions, I'm a guy, I don't need them.  The ravioli eventually will get too heavy and start to stretch and tear off....after about foot or so of raviolis are made....which is about the distance to the counter...if you are not hanging the whole thing over the edge because you have a 5ft sheet of dough  :-/  Try not to stretch the raviolis this way, as it will make it harder to separate them...but only a bit.Hope this helps.  The unit works great, well made, it would be nice if they made these attachments easier to clean, but they do work very well.  Assuming you can handle the expensive price, you will love the way it works.",5.0,Great product if one uses it correctly,1284681600,"09 17, 2010"

Properly called 'fines', it is just the nature of the press method. Try not plunging all the way to the bottom; that will help but of course still won't completely eradicate the fines. The only way to solve it would be to either pour through a filter or switch to a drip maker. The grind the Krups produces has zero to do with it.The grinder shuts off automatically after the number of cups specified has been reached. I find that if there are not enough beans to make the cups specified, it will not shut off automatically. This isn't an issue, I just press the on/off button.I've been very pleased with this grinder and count it among a small collection of kitchen gadgets I would never want to be without.",5.0,8+ years and counting,1355529600,"12 15, 2012"

Tannenbaum ""Sam""","[3, 3]","This is the only convection oven/toaster oven I've ever owned or really used, so I don't have anything to compare it with, but I'm finding it to be very useful in a variety of ways. It cooks things really evenly and consistently, so I've taken to using it for some of the stuff I cook, like cakes, where even cooking is really important- it actually outperforms my oven for things like that. It's great for toasting and heating bread- better than a toaster, because it heats more evenly and because I can (obviously) toast more than just a single slice of bread with it. It's nice to have for times when I need to bake two items at different temperatures, and the design provides a generous amount of space- there's not TOO much I can't fit into it. It's well-built and easy-to-use, and it doesn't take up that much countertop room. It has a built-in timer (up to an hour), which is nice.From my perspective, the best thing about having this oven is being able to heat smaller portions or items without having to use the full-size oven, and having them come out right- it's sort of like getting the performance of an oven with the convenience of a microwave.I really have no complaints about this oven. I suppose the more discriminating convection oven buyer might be looking for some aspect of performance I haven't covered here, but for what I need and expected, Black & Decker completely delivered. highly recommended for anyone who needs an affordable, space-effective alternative to a full-sized oven, or for anyone who needs a well-functioning convection oven.",5.0,"Convenient, easy-to-use, cooks evenly",1321833600,"11 21, 2011"

Today, I'm happy to say that it works like a dream ... not like the refurbished (same brand and model) one I received last week from another store.  On that one, #5 on the speed dial didn't work, the pulp ended up backing up and not going into the pulp bin, and the motor made a funny noise when turning off; on further inspection, some of the parts looked a little beat up, too.  Still, it was pretty quiet when juicing, but I knew I had to return it.So, I immediately went online and bought a brand new Cuisinart from Amazon (what I should have done in the first place). lol  I'm so glad I moved as quickly as I did.  It didn't take me too long to finally realized that I didn't need to start off with refurbished ... what was someone elses juicing nightmare/headache and end up going down hill from there and having to return the juicer multiple times for repair (and be without fresh juice).  The only good thing I got out of buying the refurbished juicer for less money was that it showed me what a great juicer the Cuisinart could be (if everything worked correctly, that is) ... was totally sold on the potential!  The multiple speeds, large juice pitcher, and extremely quiet motor (except when turning off) helped to sway me.This new Cuisinart is very quiet, too (unheard of, I know), and the pulp is pretty dry when not juicing something like tomatoes (just had to try that), but I can use my NutriBullet for things like that and not end up losing part of them to pulp.  As the Nutribullet is also very powerful and liquifies quite well (except for things like beets and carrots, etc), I'll probably, sometimes, end up liquifying things like tomatoes, kale, spinach, and softer fruits in the Nutribullet so I can get the benefit of the whole veggie/fruit.  At any rate, I love being able to change the speed on the Cuisinart to fit what I'm juicing.Cleanup is fairly easy with the Cuinsinart, too.  I've seen much worse, in particular the old Hamilton Beach juicer I used to have (talk about a nightmare!).  It juiced great, but cleanup was very time consuming and difficult.Also, I love size of the Cuisinart juice pitcher and the 3"" feed tube but find that for small, hard beets it's still better to cut them in thirds or quarters, but I can feed 3-5 carrots at a time without a problem.  I also juiced half a lemon with the peel on.I'm going to start looking for receipes where I can use the pulp from this machine ... maybe some veggie soup and bread ideas.  Since I'm vegetarian anyway, I don't care much for the idea of tossing perfectly good pulp/peels with their additional fiber and nutrients ... not very often anyway. lolI'm just so glad I bought this juicer and hope it lasts for a lot of years.  Just in case, I did buy the additional Square Trade 3-year warranty, as I believe it covers things the ""limited"" warranty doesn't cover.Also, with use, if I find this machine to be lacking in any way, i'll do an updated review ... or, even a review to just say how great it continues to be!Darn ... on rereading my review, it seems a bit biased, but, honestly, I'm just so excited about this juicer!

The quilt I was using just made it to the skirt ruffle but just barely made it at the end if I didn't pull the head portion beyond the edge of the bed.  So I ordered the king size.  It just touches the floor on the sides and I can actually tuck the pillows under at the head with plenty of hang over at the foot.  With the king size shams, I really don't have to do that.  I allow the foot end to also reach the floor so it's even all around and just lay the shams over the pillows since they're so big.  Works for me and looks great.

No more waiting.  Cool.  I re-checked it a month later and had to create a 2nd marking, but it is close enough for me.Well... actually... this works SO FAST, that I have so far just watched it work.  The lit up paddle however means I can easily see it turn off out of the corner of my eye.  However, you cannot wait very long after it turns off because it is not well insulated and looses that heat just as quickly.There are other kettles out there that do this, but this is by far the most cost effective and reliable one out there.I just wish it was a bit larger so I could use it to make 48 ounces at a time.One big note however... I am guessing to keep the price down, it does not seem to use a traditional thermometer, but as long as you make sure it is completely cooled down before you start, you get suprisingly consistant results (if not it has generally been colder by 10 degrees).  The readings in my tests only vary by 1 degree.  The temperature or amount of the water you pour into it does not seem to matter, but the pot must itself must start at room temperature.The dial turns about 270 degrees (not quite full circle - straight up being 1/2 way).  At the max setting, it keeps boiling the water for several seconds and creates a lot of steam.  At about 2/3 setting (just to the right of vertical), it still reaches boiling, but stops before hardly any steam is created.  Just a barely perceptable turn to the left will get it to 205 degrees and another barely perceptable turn to the left gets it to 195 degrees.  I keep mine at 201 just to be on the safe side.Since coffee is ideally brewed between 195 and 205 degrees... finding that magic spot is quite difficult.After spending an entire day finding that spot, repeatedly letting it cool and pouring 14oz of water into it over and over again, I am realizing that it cools off so quickly that it may be easier and more accurate to just bring it to a boil and let it sit for a set number of seconds.However according to coffee theory, you get better coffee if you do NOT let the water reach a boiling point (see comments for link).",5.0,"Finally, a cost-effective way to get 200 degree water.",1320364800,"11 4, 2011"

I wanted stainless steel inside & outside, and at least an 18 oz capacity.  This seems like an easy thing, but it isn't. I didn't want a ring top, and I didn't want the kind of pop-out spout that reminds me of a baby bottle. I checked now and again on Amazon, but didn't like anything I found well enough to order it.When I found this bottle on Amazon, I was highly encouraged. I liked the shape, liked the size, had confidence in the brand, liked the reviews, although I was uncertain whether I'd like the largish spout but I ordered it anyway as the reviews were so positive.The bottle is perfect. I visited the Caribbean where the water is pretty iffy and where it is very hot. I am a fuss about water quality and have been drinking distilled water for years, so drinking Caribbean ""purified"" water wasn't too appealing to me. So I also bought a Steri-Pen which I used to truly purify the water. Worked like a charm. I would fill up the Thermos bottle at the water cooler, purify the water, and I'd be all set for most of the day.  The bottle fits easily in my large purse,  it's tight as a drum so no leakage, and I really do like the large spout very much. The water bottle also has a very well-designed top which makes opening and closing the bottle very easy and keeps the outside of the bottle dry.Back home I fill it whenever I'm going to be out for the day, drop in an ice cube or two and I have cool, clean water whenever I need it.

Don't know why my fingers are often slippery when I'm handling this sort of thing--it's not as though I slide them through the butter :)--but the dishes that have no proper handle are just harder to hold onto securely.  The lower tray has a bit of depth to it which contains the butter well so it's not sliding around when you attempt to cut a piece from a cold stick.  The dish washes well in the dishwasher and is easy to carry from counter to table due to the extensions on the ends.I like to have two butter dishes in use so one can be in the dishwasher while the other is in use.  I dropped my previous glass dish that had no handle and didn't want another like that.  I ended up with this one and a larger ceramic one that would hold an even larger slab, but is really a bit too big for my limited counter space.  That one is better for table display where this one is more utilitarian looking but it is supremely functional and I'm very satisfied with it.",5.0,Very pleased,1355702400,"12 17, 2012"

They're now quite common and the prices have come down a good bit.  At one time, I think Kyocera was the sole manufacturer but now they are made in the US and other countries, as well.This is the latest addition to my ceramic knife collection and it is just as exquisitely sharp as all my others.  It is easier to cut yourself with a dull knife than a sharp one but be careful nonetheless; you can hurt yourself badly in the blink of an eye.Most people who have unhappy experiences with ceramic knives do so because they use them for other than their intended purposes.  Do not cut bones or disjoint fowl or pry with a ceramic knife.  Don't cut on anything other than wood or reasonably soft plastic cutting boards.  If you do these things you'll sooner or later chip the blade and then you will be unhappy, though you will have only yourself to blame.  I have many good steel knives and I use them for any kind of heavy work or even light work where sharpness is not much of an issue.  But if you want to slice lemons or tomatoes so thin that you can read through them, this is the knife to have.By the way, don't bother trying to resharpen them yourself.  They won't need sharpening for years if you use them properly and few of us have either the skills or the tools to hone ceramic to a keen edge.

Interestingly in unpacking I thought that the pressure regulator knob was missing. Luckily I never discard the box until every piece is accounted for. In this case this knob was found loose in the bottom of the empty inner box. The cord is over 48 inches long and very thick, with a polarized one way plug.As one reviewer said, you really do have to firmly push in the plug, or it will suddenly stop due to this. The inner pot is NON STICK, which is fine by me, although some do not prefer this. The warning says you cannot deep fry in this as it is very dangerous, can cause a fire etc. I did not know anyone would attempt to deep fry or fry in a pressure cooker.The instructions are straight forward, but must be followed exactly for getting the lid on. I suggest following the pictures showing the direction of the arrows for closing and opening.It beeps to confirm it is on when first plugged in. It beeps three times to signal it is finished.

Preset allows you to delay the cooking start time by 1-9 hours. It has a self locking lid that will not allow you to open it until pressure is zero. You cannot clean any part of this product in a dishwasher.  You do have a choice to release pressure by turning the knob to exhaust or letting it natural release. I noticed the decal got a little water underneath and wrinkled a bit, as some of the water underneath it. You have to have enough water for there to be enough steam to create pressure- at least one cup. The counter will not begin counting down until there is enough pressure. You can only fill the cooker half full with food and 4/5 full of liquid.

This is my main use of this product.

It is black and silver or stainless.  The control functions show various cooking times. The product says it is best to under cook, which can be continued later than to over cook.

In my research about the set, I looked up the type of steel used in manufacturing it (420j2 stainless steel) and learned that this is fairly soft, corrosion resistant metal which loses its edge fairly readily. It's one of the more common materials used in manufacturing inexpensive knives. Several of the reviewers of knives made from the same material recommended using an Aladdin Knife Sharpener, so I went ahead an ordered this pretty cheap sharpener as an experiment.It mounts very easily and (as advertised) ""almost anywhere"" via a single wood screw. We've got it mounted vertically on a cupboard near the stove and above our sink - the knife set is about 2 feet away.We used the Santoku knife the most, and after about a week, though not dull, the knife was definitely losing its edge. Three downward strokes in the Aladdin, and the knife INSTANTLY felt like it had just come out of the box, fully sharpened. I also sharpened one of our older serrated steak knives, and that, too, was noticeably sharper. I don't know if one should do this, but now I regularly give any knife I'm using a couple of quick downward strokes before every use. If anyone knows why I shouldn't do that regularly, let me know!This is a small, humble device that gets an easy 5 stars for doing what it says it does well. If you don't spend a lot of money on kitchen knives, this is a must-have for keeping what you do have in top sharpness.",5.0,Found out about this from another Amazon reviewer,1327968000,"01 31, 2012"

A14E7LZASLSX36,B00006JSUA,alli_g,"[3, 3]","For years and years, I avoided buying a cast iron skillet.  I'd never cooked with one and found the idea of using something not coated in teflon pretty intimidating.Then, I got this Lodge cast iron skillet.  Before using it, I read several articles online about properly seasoning, cooking with, and cleaning cast iron and followed these directions to the letter.  Even though the skillet is pre-season, I seasoned it myself using bacon grease.  I rubbed on some bacon grease, popped the skillet into the oven, heated it for a while, took it out, let it cool, then repeated.  The first couple of times I used the skillet, it produced a lot of smoke.  As the skillet becomes more seasoned over time, it smokes less.To clean my cast iron skillet, I pour avocado oil into it while it's still warm and dump in some coarse sea salt.  I use a clean, lint-free cloth to scrub the oil and salt into the skillet, removing any cooked on food.  Then, I give it a good rinse in hot water and place the skillet into a hot oven until it is dry (quickly drying with heat avoids a build up of rust).  Once the skillet is dry, I pour in just a bit of oil and spread it around before storing the pan until the next use.With good care and a bit of effort, cast iron is a kitchen essential.  I love using it to sear meats, then finishing in the oven.  It's great for bacon, corn bread, home made tortillas, and so many other things.  I wish I'd gotten a good cast iron skillet years ago, but I do enjoy making up for lost time!  This skillet is very heavy; the extra handle is there because you really do need to use it.  Unless you have arms of steel.  Which I don't.  Regardless, this is a great cast iron piece to start with and you can't beat the price!",5.0,Can't live without it!,1391990400,"02 10, 2014"

What I knew before I started using this mat is that everything supposedly slides off the sheet. What I was not aware of is that the mats also help diffuse the heat so that everything you bake comes out more evenly baked.The mat is 16.5x11, a half-sheet size, which is perfect for one pair of cookie sheets I use regularly. I tested it with cookies (shortbread cookies and chocolate chip cookies) and dinner rolls. The latter was an intentionally tough test since the recipe I use makes rolls that are notoriously difficult to cook just right. In all cases, I tested with and without the baking mat.What I found is that the claims are justified. The cookies and rolls just slid right off. The rolls, in particular, were noteworthy since I usually have to grease the cookie sheet, even non-stick cookie sheets. The batch of rolls made on the baking mat were more evenly baked, an even light brown on top and bottom, just a hint of crunch in the crust but tender and moist in the interior. They were a big hit at dinner. The cookies made on the mat weren't quite as different as those made without but I could still see a difference.Cleanup in all cases was easier than previously, since all I had to do was slide the mat out of the cookie sheet into a sink of soapy water, wipe it down with a cloth, then put it on a towel to dry. I store it flat in the cookie sheet so that it's ready to go the next time I use it.Now that I've used a silicone mat, I'm not turning back. In fact, I've placed an order for a couple more. This particular mat is very competitively priced and it got the job done. I have no hesitation in recommending it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.

AEB5O5LHW0TIX,B00390T5JA,John,"[1, 1]","Although I do not personally own a Keurig brewer, I frequently advocate for them because I've used them many times and been quite impressed. I've bought a few for family members and friends and they all love the coffee they produce, the consistency of the brew, and the ease of use.The ease of use is a huge part of the equation, and you'd expect something so cheap and convenient to produce garbage, but the coffee that comes out of these things is no joke. I'd say only some of my best coffees prepared in my french press or fancy drip brewer (laborious processes by comparison) can top what these things can pump out in under 30 seconds. It tasted like getting a cup from a freshly sealed bag every time (because it literally is), and for those who aren't used to drinking fresh coffee, it's a real surprise.OK, so now on to the bad: The only bad part about this system is the price. The price on these has really gone through the roof in recent years and this brewer already costs $30 more than I paid for it a few months ago. And then there's the price on the cups themselves. Obviously, this is an expensive way to package a very small amount of coffee, and those costs are passed on to the consumer. Normally I would knock off a star for this kind of thing but I am convinced that you are paying for the convenience and you do indeed get what you pay for.If you've been debating about whether to bite the bullet on a Keurig machine, I would highly recommend going with the standard model you're currently viewing. It might be a little more money than some of the cheaper models, but this is a workhorse model capable of pumping out thousands of cups of coffee with no cleaning or fuss. There's no annoying &#34;fill it every time&#34; water tank that can easily be overfilled like on the smaller models, which adds to the convenience and ease of use tremendously. The water tank is removable and self-containing, so you can take it right over to the sink or fridge to fill it up.

I obviously can't speak for the long-term durability of this bedframe quite yet, but it feels very sturdy and I expect it to last for years. The box itself is heavy but manageable by one person, although two people might be needed to move it in some cases. The box is long and thin - about 8 feet tall and 2 feet wide, and because of its size expect the box to come banged up. All the materials inside were well protected, however, and nothing was damaged. Assembly is very simple and easily done by one person in about 45 minutes. You just need to attach the four sides of the frame using plastic corner brackets that slide into the metal sides, screw in the middle runner, screw in the legs, and then attach the wooden slats first to each other (2 slats per row) and then to the frame. This last step calls for a mallet, but I used a standard hammer without a problem. The package comes with a small wrench and allen wrench to tighten the bolts, and this was an easy process. It completely replaces a box spring, which saves a lot of money. I've got a 12 inch foam mattress resting directly on the slats and it's a perfect set-up.

AT9U5ZE5OO84C,B005ASEZ44,"M. Kooiman ""nerdette""","[0, 0]","Several years ago I purchased two bodum double walled glasses (15 ounce I think) and fell in love with them.  The glass is sturdy and light weight.  Because they are double walled with air between, they look very cool when filled with my favorite beverage and I haven't had any problems with breakage.  Later I purchased more of the same size glass and some 8 ounce glasses as well.  Bodum updated the design because some people were having problems with their glasses breaking when a hot liquid caused the air between the walls to expand.  On the bottom of the glass is a sort of an expandable plug.  One of my larger glasses after some use and trips to the dishwasher developed a fog between the layers like you see in double paned windows.  I threw that glass away.  None of the others, however, have had any issues.  These 12 ounce glasses are nicer than the larger glasses I'd purchased earlier because the bottom of the glass is slightly wider, making them less likely to tip over.  They are also the perfect size for my family.  I don't have to worry about someone using a coaster when they set a glass on my wood coffee table because these glasses don't form condensation on the outside.  Perhaps the best feature is that the liquid inside maintains it's temperature for a much longer time than it would in a different glass.  A few nights ago I had a drink with ice in it.  I'd set it down and forgotten about it for several hours.  When I remembered my drink and went to get it, the ice had barely started to melt so it was cold and not watered down.

They dropped probably about 4 feet, and the stick part of the cone broke off. I imagine that most plastic containing frozen liquid will break when hit at a right angle. As I consider this ""user error"" and not a defect in the product, I will leave it a 5-star review. However, I will probably not buy another set since I can (and probably will) drop these again in the future. Click under the product picture ""View and share related images"" to see a picture of the break.=============================ORIGINAL REVIEW=============================I've been eyeing the Zoku (Zoku Single Quick Pop Maker, Purple) that I'd seen at Williams-Sonoma, but I wasn't sure how much I'd use an ice pop maker, so I decided to test out this less expensive Tovolo mold first to see if I'd use it a lot.Primarily, I use it to freeze yogurt.It does seem small compared to many other molds. With a 6-oz. cup of yogurt, I'm able to fill 3 molds. They are not extra-large, so I know there won't be leftovers from my 3-year old who can't eat a whole big popsicle yet. Also, I like the small portion-control aspect so I don't over-indulge.PROS:1. Big grip for a toddler2. Big drip-catcher (cone is hollow inside to catch a lot of drip)3. Slides out easily4. Makes small popsicles5. BPA-free plastic6. Cleans easily in dishwasher (dishwasher-safe)CONS:Don't have any so far.The popsicles slide out very easily when you give a few gentle twists side to side. This might be because yogurt doesn't freeze as hard as water/juice does. If you are using juice, I read on Martha Stewart that if you add more sugar to your mixture, popsicles will slide out more easily. If you don't want to use refined sugar, perhaps try alternatives like honey or raw sugar.I read a review here that says it's tough to clean by hand. I can see why, there are indeed many crevices and spaces. I wash mine in a dishwasher and it comes out clean every time. Very easy.All in all a very nice purchase for a reasonable price.

Just not worth the bother and inconvenience.This Presto bacon cooker can easily handle eight pieces at one time, and is very easy to clean, but gives you the option to use only one of the inserts to just cook four pieces for one person. Cooking with a 1200 watt microwave, four thick pieces for four minutes shrinks and crisps the bacon very well, with lots of fat left in the tray.

ACM3CGC6GNAS4,B00FEZ88IC,"The Happy Clown With A Frown ""Lisa""","[1, 1]","I receive a set of these MIRA Stainless Steel Bowls for review. These are great for lunchboxes, snack boxes, diaper bags, picnics and many other instances where you need to have a snack or some food handy. I no longer have little kids that I need to pack snacks for, but these would have been great for that! I have found them to be very useful on my weekends when I attend fiber guild workshops, have clowning jobs or when I am going to be gone from the house for most of the day. These work great for fresh vegetables, trail mix, peanuts, small crackers and more. I even used the smaller of the two for my salad dressing when I carried my lunch to my fiber guild meeting a few weeks ago. The bowl was inside my lunch box where it couldn't really get tipped upside down but my lunchbox itself did get knocked around a bit before lunchtime, but when I took everything out, the salad dressing in the MIRA bowl was just fine and had not spilled or leaked at all.I have been very pleased and impressed with these bowls. I love that they are easy to clean and that they also feature non-toxic kid-friendly easy-snap secure lids that are free of BPA, phthalates, PVC and lead. I don't want to use harmful products to store my own food and certainly don't want my son exposed to those things either!These containers are made of unlined 18/8 food-grade stainless steel and the lids are made of non-toxic LDPE number 4 plastic. The smaller one holds  ounces and the larger one holds 8 ounces. These a perfect snack packing solution. They are eco-friendly and reusable. The possibilities of what you can pack in them are nearly endless: fresh or dried fruit, nuts, cheerios, pretzels, sandwiches, hummus, and more! And you can feel good knowing you aren't using a throw-away product or something that will harm your or your family's health.",5.0,Great Set of Eco Friendly Bowls!!,1396656000,"04 5, 2014"
A3V0D97QKXDN5R,B000PDWB6I,"T. Morris ""On The High Desert""","[0, 0]","I purchased the Deluxe Mr. Beer kit that included the bottles but I didn't want to wait until the beer was gone to brew the next batch. Yes, there are many alternatives to buying these bottles but I liked the fact that they're PET and that there's room for them to expand a bit during the carbonation process. I also purchased a case or half liter bottles directly from Mr. Beer so that I could have several brews going at the same time. I'm going with the 2-2-2 process of letting it ferment 2 weeks, carbonate for 2 weeks and then chill another 2 weeks before drinking it so waiting about 3 months to get enough empties to bottle another batch seems to long for an impatient person like me. The 1 liter bottles seems much better for me because the half liter ones were more difficult to fill and I ended up with 1 more bottle than I had beer to fill it. the Mr. Beer site has prices that are less then Amazon but with their flat rate shipping you need to get more than a few items to make up for it. I have purchased refill kits, bottles, cleaning supplies and a sugar measurer and all their prices were less than I found elsewhere.

A1YETX467CJV00,B000A3G0F6,P. Smith,"[6, 6]","This is a quick update on the first review written about 6 months ago.  Just wanted to let everyone know that I've used this Jaccard tenderizing marvel at least twice a week.  It's all I said it was and more.  As time passed I was concerned the blades would become a little ""off"" and not slide back through the blade guides easily.  I had read a few reviews claiming that re-assembling was a problem for them. I now feel confident that the Jaccard they received was either defective to start with or they were a little too rough with it.  I do treat my tenderizer with care.  After at least 50 uses, 50 times taking it apart, running it through the dishwasher, and putting it back together, it's just as easy to do as it was the very first time I did it....a flawless process. Running it through the dishwasher does get it perfectly clean.  If I'm not going to run the dishwasher right away I'll sit the Jaccard in hot soapy water and take apart just before I start the washer.  That way tiny pieces of raw meat don't dry and stick in tiny nooks.  I'm a clean freak in the kitchen and I'm happy. This is a product everyone who eats beef and wants to save money should have. Now check out my original review.  I've been thinking about ordering this meat tenderizer for a while now.  Finally did it...and am I  glad I did.  Knowing it was soon to be delivered, I purchased a package of petite sirloin steaks at the sale price of $1.29 a lb..  You could tell just by looking at them they were not tender at all. For sure a sale I would have quickly passed up with just one look if it had not been for the fact I was looking for ""experimental"" tuff meat.  The Jaccard arrived.  I defrosted one of  the steaks.  The meat was so tuff I had a hard time getting a fork through it.  I ran the tenderizer over it about 8  times watching to make sure the meat was not falling apart.  I added my seasonings before the last two passes over the meat.  I heated a cast iron pan, added a little margarine and seared the steak on both sides to seal in the juice oozing from all the cuts in the meat.  I turned the steak in the hot pan every minute or so until it was med rare.  To my surprise the steak was as tender as could be and sooo tasty.  No more expensive cuts of meat for me.  It's very obvious that if you're working with a relatively tender cut of meat, chicken, or fish, one or two passes over the meat would be enough.  But this thing can really do a fabulous job of tenderizing tuff meat if you stab it enough times.  I had no problem with taking the Jaccard apart for cleaning.  The cartridge came out easily and went right back into place with no effort whatsoever.  This is the best money I've spent in a long time and will save me big bucks buying cheaper cuts of meat.  By the way,  the flavor of the cheaper cut was extremely flavorful.",5.0,WHAT A HAPPY SURPRISE!!!,1258243200,"11 15, 2009"

A3E4H4V7RT7C3I,B007JOJ9QQ,Stefan,"[6, 8]","I bought this vacuum robot a few days ago and i keep it busy to see what it really can do. It is cleaning about 3000 sqft of tile and laminate flooring. Very nice to see right at the beginning was the mapping of the room. The machine first starts the vacuum and brush, turns on its spot and then slowly drives around the boundary of the room. If it is a large room, the robot decides to clean it in sections. Very nice is that the robot does not clean the areas in random motions but in a sweeping motion, going back and fourth with a nice overlap and usually does not bump into any furniture. The operating time of 1 hour seems short but the mapping of the room and the calculated sweeping cleaning keeps the machine pretty efficient. However recharging in suspended cleaning mode is around 2 hours.The vacuum suction power seems to be way stronger than i have seen from my 551 Roomba, with a strong airflow exiting the rear of the machine. However, the Roomba has, as the XV 21, not left any (or much) dirt behind. The XV 21 is by far not as noisy as the Roomba.Pro:Gets more cleaning done in 1 hour than a roombaCleaning brush is 50% wider than the one of the roombaNot as noisy as the RoombaMapping of the room, sweeping cleaning motion, no random cleaningNo bumping into obstaclesReturning to the station after the batteries are exhausted and returns to the room and the exact location in the room, where it stopped cleaning after it is recharged and continues its cleaning (it does recharge 2 times, meaning there are 3 consecutive cleaning cycles).Easy cleaning of the dust bin, no messy pulling of the dirt bin from the robot. The bin is located on top of the machine and is easy to clean outCon:Only 1 hour of cleaning and 2 hours of recharging (my Roomba recharges faster), so a full consecutive cleaning of 3 hours of the XV 21 takes about 7 hours total.No side rotating brush like the Roomba has, so it cannot clean the cornersThe Pet dander filter needs to get cleaned more often, the dirt bin is not nearly filled and the robot is showing on the display, that the filter needs to get cleanedConclusion. If i had to buy a Neato Robot again i probably would go for the XV-11 as i believe that i really don't need this allergen filter element. In fact i already ordered the regular filter of the XV-11 for my XV 21, as i believe that they provide me with enough filtration for my use. Pet and Allergy Vacuum Cleaner may sound very good but i believe if you really want great cleaning of your carpet, then you may want to go with a regular vacuum cleaner instead. I cannot see any battery driven vacuum cleaner being as strong as a cord powered vacuum cleaner with, lets say, 1000 Watts.I only bought the XV 21 because it comes with a beater/brush combination, unlike the XV 11, which comes only with a beater drum.I hope this review was helpful to the readers",5.0,"Very nice machine, outperforms the Roomba 500 series by far",1342742400,"07 20, 2012"

The mug is thick and simply feels ready to be cracked into your friends mugs.There was another review saying these only hold 16 ounces, not 20. Well..... even though these are made in the USA, they seem to be 20 *Imperial* ounces. An imperial ounce is 1/160th of a gallon, whereas it is 1/128th in the USA.

AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B002MZYZHU,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[1, 2]","Disclaimer: I must state in advance that I own the older model of this, which didn't have an iced beverage option, but otherwise is just the same.Even without that option, every penny I paid on this has been worth it in every way. I bought it after experiencing the joys of it at work. I will never, ever go back to a carafe-style brewer. I am awake, for work, three to four hours earlier than my housemate most days. Before I purchased this, whomever got up last either had burnt coffee or had to start from scratch with the coffee process- wash the carafe & filter holder, dry them thoroughly, get out a paper filter without trying to tear it, putting it ever-so-carefully in the holder, making sure you didn't do one too mnay or one too few scoops of coffee, hope you don't scatter any grounds anywhere, wait for it to brew- and meanwhile, you're half-blind & brain-addled from just waking up. Then, when done, take the wet, soggy filter filled with the old grounds & hope you don't get any drips on the floor or miss the trashcan & clean grounds up. No thanks.Now, I flip the on/off switch, wait for the water to heat up on this machine (takes about two minutes), pick my K-cup, let it brew & enjoy fresh coffee every single time. I like flavored coffee- my housemate doesn't. Now, it doesn't matter, because we can each choose what we want each time. When my grandmother comes to visit, she's got English breakfast tea awaiting her, piping hot from the same machine. My friends? Green tea, hot chocolate, or anything else they wish. Sometimes after one mug, my stomach says ""enough"" & I'm done- other times, it's one of those mornings where I'll be lingering over three mugs in a long a.m. No burnt coffee, no stealing anyone else's portion, no wasted coffee because it got stale, cold or burnt. Hallelujah!It has four size settings. Mine stays on the second-to-highest cup setting for precise flavor & a good amount in a bistro-style mug. I use the smallest-cup setting when I want very concentrated coffee or tea for coffee/chai drinks. Changing the brew size is just this- go to the menu, hit the arrow key a few times, and hit the arrow keys again. Done. Setting the clock? Equally as easy. I always keep mine on the hottest temperature, but that's as easily changed, too. I've never had any problems with the clock slowing- the only annoying thing is there's no battery backup or anything to keep the time set if the power goes out. But I have yet to find a coffeemaker with said feature.The K-cups aren't what I'd call cheap, but they are manageable. I love ordering coffee, trying different & new flavors, and I love variety- so I actually prefer this to the old bags bought at the store. If someone is on a strict budget, this may not be the best gift for them, if they go through a lot of coffee. Otherwise, I think it's a great gift idea. My housemate has a no-new-technology brain, and even they operated this alone the first time without my help & without an instruction manual (unheard of, trust me).In terms of care & maintenance, I wipe the machine down on the outside with glass cleaner as needed. The removable K-cup holder, I wash & dry with regular dishwashing liquid each week. I run plain water through the machine to get any loose grounds that may build up about once a week, usually two to three times a session. I wipe down the area directly around the K-cup holder with a damp (water-only) cloth once a week, too. The whole process takes less than five minutes once a week, and as long as this is done, I experience no problems with the machine. A new filter must be put in every other month- not a big deal. Most coffeemakers have a filter, it does the machine & your tastebuds good. That is a simple process, too, and the filters are readily available. Pouring fresh water into the tank is easy with a 4-cup Pyrex measuring cup, or you can dislodge the tank & refill it under the tap. The machine is still spotless after three years, everything being made of high-quality materials to begin with.I've owned it for over three years & it's still beautiful & it still works great.

A37CKQPJ6CJED2,B005CN5JEM,Southern Review,"[8, 9]","I almost missed out on this wonderful kitchen tool due to several ditzy negative reviews located on the web. The review that most dissuaded my initial purchase complained about the curvature of the grating surface. This turned out to be a non-issue.My ratty old box grater had become so dull that ""you could ride to town on it"", as my salty Scottish grandmother might have quipped.  When shopping at Target for basic sundries one morning, I decided that anything would surpass the performance of my old dull grater.I am so glad I bought this model. Few simple kitchen tools have delighted me more.Cautions about fingers are well ordered.While it makes serious grated white potatoes for dilled potato pancakes and Lithuanian Kugelis,  I had forgotten how versatile box graters are. Here are just a few things for which I find them useful besides shredding cheese. They are wonderful for quickly shredding boiled eggs to prepare an egg salad. My basic recipe adds Dijon mustard, yellow mustard seed, white pepper, and Lawry's Seasoned Salt to homemade mayonnaise. Additions of capers, olives, herbs, annatto; optional.Box graters are handy for a fast puree of tomato. Slice very ripe Roma tomatoes long-wise, press the cut surface to the grate, then grate the pulp up to the tomato skin, while collecting its juice and pulp over a flat bowl.This pulp when added to plain water, sea salt, a bit of turmeric, scant garlic and annatto powder, works well for preparing fried Mexican rice, or combined with saffron; it makes fried saffron basmati rice. The pulp from one Roma tomato lends a delicate flavor/color. ~ Consider: making extra rice as it freezes well.LBJ's barbeque chef once published an obscure cookbook from which we enjoyed many surprisingly delicious recipes. - That was likely LBJ's only contribution to society.....I digress. His chef offered a recipe for ""fresh marinated cucumber relish"" that utilized whole grated cucumber to which I add dill seed, mustard seed, Lawry's, cayenne, fresh dill, garlic, (onion?) Italian parsley, and a balanced scant amount of oil and vinegar. Chill a few hours and serve with a dollop of sour cream.I also grate English, Armenian, or hothouse cucumbers for chilled cucumber soup. The shredded cucumbers are macerated in salt, garlic, dill and seasonings for a couple hours until they yield their juices, to which is added kefir cheese (""Lebni""), or, substitute with either yogurt, or sour cream. Chill. And serve with fresh dill and crouton. Delicious in the summer heat.College students on a budget can successfully make their own French bread crumbs by freezing a baguette, then carefully grating it on the coarse grate over a waxed paper surface.Lastly one of my favorite new methods with this new tool is grating fresh firm mushrooms on the thick grate that are incorporated into excellent meat mixtures, terrines, and savory stuffing.Mushrooms  can infamously ruin dishes by throwing off their moisture content during cooking and making stuffing soggy.A new discovery of mine,  that is simple but requires much patience and up to a few hours, but is rewarded with an excellent ""stuffing.""~Grate about a pound of mushrooms (white, Portobello, crimini, etc) and combine them with about five loose cups of your bread of choice (crouton, French bread crumbs),  I use the later or old, good quality small bread cubes.  Toss the bread and grated mushroom together in a very large bowl. The final result will only yield about 30% of the initial volume. Thus a concentrated mushroom-flavored result.Give the mixture a toss and gentle, loving squeeze every 15 minutes, or so. Depending on the freshness of the mushrooms, they will begin to throw off their liquid content into the bread mixture, more and more, as they delightfully moisten the bread. You will note that it is looking more and more like a wonderful stuffing without any added bouillon. Mid-way (when the volume is about half) I add a full bunch of chopped Italian flat leaf parsley, fresh thyme, and a cup of good quality Parmesan, if not Riggiano. Eventually, the mixture represents a moist collection of ingredients that have been mingling for hours and will taste extraordinarily good. This is the ""base"" from which you may add your own seasoning, I add white pepper. Use an easy hand on seasoning as this mixture accentuates flavors and a little goes a long way.It is good for meat balls, stuffed eggplant, stuffed zucchini, stuffed pork chops, a rolatini of fish, rolatini of eggplant, rolatini veal or chicken. Also a great stuffing for quail & roast chicken. Last night I combined the finished moist stuffing with a pound of good quality ground raw pork and stuffed red, orange and yellow bell peppers to the compliments of my diners.Buon Appetito!",5.0,~ Love at First Grate!,1376006400,"08 9, 2013"

A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,B000S5R74O,RatherLiveInKeyWest,"[25, 27]","Purchased this Shark handheld vacuum about two months ago and have used it at least once per week since, so feel comfortable reviewing it now.The unit we received has decent sucking power, but you really have to put your hand right up to its mouth to feel it... meaning, this is not a big, upright vacuum that sucks in debris from two or three inches away. It is made for, and does a good job, sucking things in along the crack of stairs (and especially along the wall/carpet line in our teenage son's room) when you move its mouth over the stuff you are trying to suck up. Bottom line is that this handheld operates as expected, and picks up things very well.Cleaning the collection basket is fairly easy; accessing the debris area is done by the simple push of a button, and the basket comes out without any difficulty, allowing us to just dump everything into a trash bag.  We have a Golden Retriever, so the only real challenge is getting the fine hair and dust out of the fabric of the basket itself, in order to make sure that we get the best air flow possible after cleaning. What we have done a couple times is take a blow dryer outside and lightly blow air through the backside of the basket for a few seconds... and this worked very well.Another benefit over other handheld vacuums is that this one is much lighter than ones we have had in the past. That is very nice for us all but especially for my wife, who had carpal tunnel issue years ago and still is very cautious with her wrists.We use this for quick job that take five to 10 minutes or so each time. The battery charge seems to get through two or three such jobs before needing a recharge, and yes the 16 hour recharge process is a bit odd and needs to be thoughtfully managed (like putting it on charge around dinnertime in order for it to be ready for use by 10AM the next day).This lightweight handheld vacuum does not have brute force sucking power, and its charging process can be tedious, but we knew that before purchasing and this Shark has met our expectations.

A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B00418485K,M. Hill,"[11, 18]","Margaritaville is a brand, not a drink that should be prepared in this machine. Perhaps a more appropriate name would be Martiniville because it performs perfectly when preparing that particular drink. Obviously shots will work well along with any drink that is at least seventy percent alcohol and no more than thirty percent mixer. Mess with those proportions and the concoction will freeze and not dispense.The machine requires few instructions. Before first use and before plugging in, pour twenty-five ounces of warm water into the reservoir and completely dispense the liquid. I performed this flush a second time, and repeated the procedure after each use to ensure all residue is removed from the machine. When ready, pour a 750 ml bottle or a twenty-five ounce mixture into the reservoir and plug in the machine. The already large footprint may limit this idea, but included is a small slide out tray that will display the bottle of liquor that is contained within.I tested both martinis and mud slides (Kahlua, Bailey's Irish Cr&egrave;am and vodka,) and started both solutions at room temperature. Ultra-cold (approximately fifteen degrees Fahrenheit) was reached in just under four hours. It takes two hours to reach the normal freezing temperature of thirty-two degrees. Instructions within the booklet say it will only take minutes to reach ultra-cold if using a bottle stored in the freezer. When a below freezing temperature is reached, a compass light appears on the drip tray to both alert the users it is time to imbibe, and to direct those who have had a few, precisely where to place their glass for a refill. My perception was that the martini seemed colder, but I'm sure that was due to the lighter drink over the rather dense mud slide.The handle does not release a pre-measured quantity, so everyone has complete control over the size of their drink. Also, it is incredibly convenient to mix a batch of martinis and have them available, beyond ice cold, with a pull on the machine. For a large or lengthy party, one suggestion in the enclosed booklet is to keep an extra bottle or two in the freezer so the length of time to reach ultra cold is reduced. Ice in a drink can quickly dilute the taste. This provides a method to avoid the problem. I did notice that room temperature glassware caused the temperature of the drinks to quickly warm up, so use of iced glasses may be worth the extra step.The enclosed user manual is printed on brown bag paper with light brown ink making it stylish in appearance but a little annoying to read. There are instructions for use along with recipes and the limited one year Sunbeam warranty is detailed along with frequently asked questions. The drip tray and reservoir cover are not dishwasher safe, so be sure to wash by hand in warm soapy water -- and nothing else should be immersed in water. And also be careful not to allow any pulp or other solid materials in the drink mix or the dispenser will clog.This is a large appliance and takes up quite a bit of counter space, so I plan to take it out only for entertaining. It should not be left plugged in when empty and I'm not sure if keeping it full of alcohol wouldn't eventually start to corrode the reservoir. I tested it with a full reservoir along with partially filled and it worked fine no matter the quantity used.I noticed that approximately the final shot of liquor refused to dispense and since there is no way to remove the reservoir, there is no easy way to retrieve the remaining mixture, so plan on a little liquor loss. I also noted that the spout dripped one or two drops at the end of each drink onto the appropriately named drip tray unless the glass is left in place for an unacceptable length of time. Small thing, but this causes the next glass to be placed, in the case of the mudslide, in a sticky liquid which is then transferred wherever the glass is placed and quickly makes the machine look sloppy.The majority of the appliance is made of plastic. When plugged in, it is quite festive looking with its glowing blue light. On its own the machine's appearance creates quite a party atmosphere. I have attached three photographs in the customer images section which help illustrate the appearance and compass light. It is unfortunate it is not for outdoor use because it would look great in an outdoor kitchen set-up. The machine does what it is supposed to do - for a party it keeps martinis and shots at an ultra cold temperature, ready to dispense.",5.0,Sets the mood for a perfect Summer party,1306454400,"05 27, 2011"

I was worried about the reviews of those who stated it tasted like plastic.  I rinsed the appliance 2x as instructed and made my first cup using Dunkin' Donuts brand coffee with the bold setting, as instructed for higher quality blend coffees. I noticed no plastic flavor in my coffee.  Tasted like a good cup you would expect from a Keurig brand machine, as I have a few of those as well.  I'm deployed to Qatar and have no access to K-cups, just regular packaged coffee.  This machine gives me the convenience of a Keurig without buying any K-cups, as well as providing a similar quality of coffee one would expect from the higher priced machines.Those complaining about weak coffee are probably packing the grounds too hard, or their machine has chalk from hard water.  Perhaps they should switch coffee brands to a coarser grind and use bottled water.  Anyway, I have seen no issues as seen from other negative responses.  Also, I know how to keep my coffee maker clean, as both my Keurig machines have lasted 3+ years so far.One downside to this coffee maker is cleanup is a little more taxing than a Keurig machine, in that the grounds have to be dumped and I rinse out both filters, both the grounds cup and the secondary strainer.  Takes a little more time than just removing a K-cup cartridge, bit the savings are worth the extra effort, so that negates the downside.If you can handle the little more effort to maintain this appliance, I strongly recommend it.

A24H9HC0PWU1LJ,B00022HYIM,SEN,"[13, 13]","Oh, how I LOVE my Roomba Red! I've never had a robotic vacuum before. After reading a bunch of reviews about previous models and other brands, I found this brand new version which has solved what the reviewers were complaining about. He has a big dirt chamber so he doesn't fill up as quickly, has very sturdy wheels, automatically figures out how big a room is, has a spot clean mode, and a side brush. How wonderful! Also he comes with 2 extra filters (3 total), a charger for the battery (it's a 7 hour charger so you can plug him in, go to bed, and he'll be ready to clean when you get up), a virtual wall (which is needed if you want to make him just clean the hall, etc.), and a handy little brush cleaning tool.When I got my Roomba Red I couldn't help but take him right out of the box. He needed charged but had enough power to run around for 5 minutes which was very exciting to see how he maneuvers. Then I plugged him into his charger (so easy to use) and left him for the night. The next day I had him clean the living room, the hallway, and two bedrooms (all on one charge). It was great! I have problems with my back so a regular vacuum is a nightmare for me. My Roomba Red does the back breaking work for me while I surf the web or whatever. However he does occasionally get stuck. I didn't pick up the bedroom as well as I should've and he got stuck on a power cord, but he turned off the power, and beeped for help. It sounds like he's saying ""uh, oh."" It's cute. Then I picked him up, turned him back on, and he went right back to work. No problem. You wouldn't believe how much cat fur he picked up! I didn't think the floors were that bad but they were. He's also very easy to empty. The back just slides off. His brushes need cleaned every few vacuumings but that's not much harder than cleaning a regular hair brush, and with that little tool it just takes a couple of minutes. In addition, he has a very good filter. I have allergies and I have no problem being around my Roomba Red while he's working. However, when dumping out the dirt chamber I need a dust mask, but for me that's true of any bagless vacuum.The only downside to Roomba Red is my living room has area rugs. That side sweep makes him get stuck on the rugs. Once I took the side sweep off he did much better. The side sweep comes off with just a screwdriver and can be put back on just easily. If you don't have area rugs this vacuum will work fabulously in your house.Also, he does take longer than if you vacuumed the house yourself, but the fact that you can spend that time and energy elsewhere more than makes up for that.All in all, I love my Roomba Red! He's my little worker bee that saves me a lot of energy.",5.0,My personal slave!!!,1098144000,"10 19, 2004"

Nothing hurts coffee flavor more than stale oils. Mildewey reservoir surfaces don't help either. For ease of keeping these surfaces clean, this little Zojirushi wins hands down. Nothing else comes even close.(1) The ""splash guard"" (just above where hot water hits the ground coffee) is easy to remove and clean with running water. With other coffeemakers, one would need to hold the whole appliance upside-down under the tap. :O(2) The water reservior and cover are both easily removed for inspection, cleaning and complete drying.(3) The carafe's inner surfaces are easy to see, reach, clean and rinse. (Same as all coffeemakers with Pyrex-type carafes.)This machine's other notable feature is the water filter (which can remove undesired flavors from the water just after heating.) I tried my Zojirushi with and without the filter and didn't notice much difference. But the tap water in my town is actually very good, so this doesn't amount to much of a test. I can imagine it helping with, for example, the water where I used to live.Other aspects of this coffeemaker are good but not unique. The water temperature in mine is about right. (It extracts the right stuff from the ground coffee.) The hot plate is good for warming the carafe during coffeemaking but should then should be turned off to avoid thermal mishandling of the coffee.

The handles gives you adequate leverage so squeezing the cloves is easy.You should press the cloves over a catching dish or a cooking pan.  Take the edge of a knife and scrap the minced garlic off the bottom of the press.  If you pressed the garlic with the peeling still on, simply open the basket and remove the peel.You can squeeze as many cloves as you wish before cleaning the press.
